16:02:21 <gundalow> Anyone around today?
16:02:38 <echou> Hi, ericchou1 is around for the meeting
16:03:37 <ericchou1> just changed my nick name to match github handle
16:03:40 <gundalow> ericchou1: Hi, you from A10 Networks?
16:03:50 <ericchou1> I am
16:04:46 <gundalow> #topic a10_command & a10_config
16:05:58 <gundalow> privateip: ericchou1 from a10 is asking https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110#issuecomment-259194196
16:06:37 <gundalow> #chair privateip
16:06:37 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos gundalow privateip
16:07:37 <privateip> two modules would make more sense
16:07:48 <ericchou1> ok
16:08:03 <privateip> modules should focus on doing one thing and doing it well
16:08:36 <ericchou1> agreed, I mostly wanted to make sure that is what other people think as well
16:08:54 <ericchou1> since the dev for AXAPI purposely merged the two methods from before
16:09:05 <gundalow> Good idea to ask *before* doing all the work, rather than after :)
16:09:16 <ericchou1> :)
16:09:34 <alikins> howdy
16:09:46 <gundalow> ericchou1: How do you currently test the a10 network modules?
16:09:49 <gundalow> alikins: Hi :)
16:10:01 <ericchou1> I test them in my lab
16:10:15 <ericchou1> I have not looked at the test folder, is there any test for A10?
16:10:24 <gundalow> Not yet
16:10:42 <ericchou1> I can also supply a VM with 1 year key
16:10:55 <ericchou1> if needed
16:10:56 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/test/integration/README.md#network-tests
16:11:20 <gundalow> That would be great
16:11:37 <ericchou1> ok, how should I go about doing that?
16:11:45 <ericchou1> besides contributing to test cases
16:11:53 <ericchou1> re: A10 VM
16:12:30 <gundalow> details to me John Barker - jobarker@redhat.com
16:12:34 <gundalow> Would be great
16:13:07 <ericchou1> got it, thank you
16:13:22 <ericchou1> I am at ericc@a10networks.com
16:13:29 <ericchou1> for reference
16:13:51 <gundalow> Thanks
16:14:31 <gundalow> You can see from the existing directories the type of tests we have, and README.md should give enough detail on the what & how. If not let me know and I'll update the documentation
16:14:59 <ericchou1> ok, got it. Also for reference that I work on the security product side of A10, a.k.a TPS
16:15:21 <ericchou1> so I will start down that path for modules as well
16:15:39 <ericchou1> like DDoS enable, Protected Object cration
16:16:10 <gundalow> Excellent
16:17:39 <ericchou1> cool. nothing else from me.
16:17:42 * gundalow is @gundalow on GitHub. Feel free to @mention me, or poke me on here for any help. I'm also on networktocode's slack channel
16:17:57 <ericchou1> thank you
16:18:14 <gundalow> No problem at all
16:18:27 <gundalow> Well there wasn't anything else on the agenda
16:19:05 <ericchou1> have a good rest of day/night
16:19:16 <gundalow> You too
