16:11:33 <mikewiebe> gundalow:  Need to read through the info on the summit but will send questions your way
16:11:51 <Salman_> The netowrk-working-group page on github should be updated to mention that network meeting happens on ansible-meetinf channel and not on ansible-network..

16:13:26 <gundalow> Salman_: Could you please send me a link to that page and I'll update it
16:14:07 <gundalow> #topic Meetings next week
16:14:30 <gundalow> #info Most of the Ansible Core team are getting together next week, so no IRC meetings
16:14:33 <Salman_> https://github.com/ansible/community/tree/master/group-network
16:15:51 <gundalow> Salman_: thanks, fixed https://github.com/ansible/community/commit/93a22cebacb2dd97b513aaf4405fdd55bea79d19#diff-219e2e3f3978a035b183f1db9624b311
16:16:19 <gundalow> #topic ios_command: unable to show the bgp vpnv4 route #26577
16:16:28 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/26577
16:17:04 <gundalow> #info IRC:Salman_ = GitHub:@AnsiNoob
16:17:07 <gundalow> Salman_: over to you
16:17:50 <Salman_> So show bjp fails on IOS-command and it was fixed per the thread
16:18:35 <Salman_> But now with latest devel version even a basic iOS command fails when I use IOS-command module. I have updated details on the page
16:19:26 <Qalthos> Based off the error you are getting, you still don't seem to have the latest devel version of ios module_utils
16:20:15 <Salman_> I did a git pull and have the version details in the page
16:20:42 <Qalthos> I'm not sure how long it's been gone, but NetworkModule and NetworkError have not been in module_utils/ios.py for a long time
16:21:02 <Qalthos> (should look like https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils/ios.py)
16:21:31 <Salman_> Ok will check
16:21:38 <Qalthos> Salman_: right, which is why I'm not sure what's going on
16:22:01 <Salman_> I need to see why my git pull did not update module util. Probably I will clone again
16:22:10 <Salman_> Will update the thread with details
16:22:43 <Qalthos> and with all the paths snipped out, I can't tell if something is overriding the built-in modules
16:23:23 <Salman_> They are not. I can assure you that. I only snipped the path where we cloned ansible devel version
16:23:55 <Salman_> Anyways, I will check once more and update the thread. Thanks for your time.
16:23:57 * gundalow -> awk
16:24:08 <gundalow> Qalthos: You ok chairing?
16:24:30 <Qalthos> gundalow: I can take over
16:25:10 * dag wants to discuss Cisco ACI modules today as well
16:25:50 <Qalthos> #topic Cisco ACI modules
16:26:10 <Qalthos> dag: can you give some context?
16:27:31 <dag> Qalthos: we have been working hard the past 2 weeks on making a set of ACI modules
16:27:55 <dag> this is to be shipped with v2.4 (the modules existed for a long time, but were not idempotent, no check-mode or diff-mode)
16:28:02 <dag> so we refactored all of them
16:28:16 <dag> Progress is available from: https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/Network:-ACI
16:28:53 <dag> The actual development is happening here: https://github.com/datacenter/aci-ansible
16:29:13 <dag> I was wondering how the module freeze will reflect on our work
16:29:34 <dag> so I guess we are bound by the 29/8 community module freeze
16:29:55 <dag> I assume that the repository is being forked at that time in some way
16:30:05 <dag> and that everything before that time is going to ship with v2.4 ?
16:31:12 <dag> the reason why I am asking is that we expect another 20+ set of modules for ACI the coming week
16:31:26 <funzo> that is correct on the timing and branching
16:31:31 <dag> (and these modules will cover a large set of what normal users would be needing)
16:31:54 <dag> funzo: ok
16:32:05 <dag> even for new ACI modules
16:32:51 <funzo> we won't be merging new modules into devel once the freeze happens
16:33:30 <dag> aha, so there's also a window where devel stays frozen ?
16:33:41 <dag> (for new modules)
16:33:44 <dag> good to know
16:34:13 <funzo> we will be merging bug fixes though
16:34:18 <dag> sure
16:35:19 <funzo> let me check with jimi to see if i'm telling lies
16:35:27 <funzo> er toshio
16:35:29 <funzo> sec
16:35:45 <dag> we will be renaming a large set of modules so that it is easier for users to find/use those modules
16:36:14 <abadger1999> in the past we'vefrozen devel but we *may* try branching stable-2.4 instead of that this time.
16:36:49 <abadger1999> I wanted to branch stable-2.4 today, so that there was no time when devel was frozen for anything but others thought it would be too much owrk.
16:36:56 <abadger1999> so it's a little in the air.
16:37:11 <abadger1999> But module freeze date was one possible date for branching.
16:37:45 <funzo> abadger1999: ok, that's consistent with what I got from jimi. it sounded like he was on board for not freezing devel after we branch for 2.4
16:38:00 <abadger1999> yep, once we branch we can unfreeze devel
16:38:05 <funzo> so we would be able to merge new modules into devel
16:38:12 <funzo> dag: does that help?
16:39:23 <jmcgill> hi
16:39:41 <MeganLiu-meirong> hi, I am sorry for interruption. Is it still possible to go through #26855 on today meeting (I forgot to add it before the meeting starts)?
16:40:13 <Qalthos> MeganLiu-meirong: you are next on the agenda
16:40:53 <Qalthos> and if anyone else has something they'd like to raise, adding it to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110 should help it not get lost
16:42:08 <jmcgill> sorry I'm late, but see that you are talking about ACI, any questions for me on that?
16:42:35 <Qalthos> just waiting to see if dag has any more concerns
16:44:03 <Qalthos> Right, I'm gonna move on then
16:44:32 <Qalthos> #topic Fusionlayer Infinity
16:44:42 <Qalthos> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26855
16:44:55 <MeganLiu-meirong> hi, for this module, I would like to know what I need to do next?
16:45:03 <Qalthos> MeganLiu-meirong: you seem to have deleted your module instead of moving it
16:45:18 <MeganLiu-meirong> I moved it into another directory
16:45:24 <MeganLiu-meirong> from network into net_tools
16:45:34 <Qalthos> MeganLiu-meirong: the file in net_tools is empty, which is why the errors
16:46:39 <dag> laptop issues
16:46:40 <MeganLiu-meirong> oh.. I will  add the code there then
16:46:47 <Qalthos> Get the file back in the PR and it'll be mergeable again
16:46:48 <MeganLiu-meirong> sorry about that
16:47:15 <Qalthos> dag: anything else you needed?
16:47:22 <dag> funzo: thanks, very useful to know
16:47:26 <dag> Qalthos: nope, thanks !
16:47:36 <Qalthos> Yay
16:47:37 <MeganLiu-meirong> yes.. but another question, after I put the file back again.. do I have to do anything else?
16:47:53 <MeganLiu-meirong> original it was in network directory and pass the shippable test
16:50:27 <Qalthos> Probably not? If you followed the comments before, and it passes Shippable again, I can't see anything else it needs
16:52:35 <MeganLiu-meirong> Qalthos:  but  finally I will merge the code into ansible repo or someone else ?
16:55:36 <Qalthos> Assuming no more issues come up, someone will merge it
16:56:54 <MeganLiu-meirong> Qalthos: one more question,  is that module going to be shipped with ansible 2.4, am I correct?
16:58:58 <Qalthos> if it gets fixed before the 29th, then yes
16:59:14 <MeganLiu-meirong> so 29th is the deadline..
16:59:51 <Qalthos> after that, no chance for 2.4
17:00:37 <MeganLiu-meirong> thanks for the information :)
17:00:50 <Qalthos> MeganLiu-meirong: Anything else from you?
17:01:14 <MeganLiu-meirong> thanks for going through the module, I do not have any more questions :)
17:01:50 <Qalthos> Well, that's the end of the agenda, and I don't see any of my NX-OS friends here, so we'll end on time today
17:02:02 <Qalthos> Thanks all for coming!
17:02:17 <MeganLiu-meirong> Thanks for hosting the meeting :)
