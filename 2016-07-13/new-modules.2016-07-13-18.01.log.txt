18:01:16 <gregdek> #topic roll call
18:01:20 <gregdek> Who's about for a new modules meeting?
18:01:40 <gregdek> It'll probably be just open floor for anyone who's advocating for a new module today...
18:02:02 <rbergeron> i'm here!
18:02:15 <ryansb> hi!
18:02:22 <rbergeron> i don't have any new modules to advocate for, though, except "any of them" :)
18:02:25 * Qalthos waves
18:02:37 * ryansb advocates module I PR'd 2 minutes ago https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2558
18:03:01 * svg advocates all his modules, which are 0 new atm
18:04:03 <gregdek> Very helpful, all. LOL.
18:04:34 <gregdek> Ooh, a new lambda module!
18:05:02 <svg> SERVERLESS suits ansible very much thank you
18:05:14 <gregdek> :)
18:05:19 <gregdek> #topic Open Floor
18:05:37 <ryansb> svg: you don't have to sell me on it :)
18:06:05 <gregdek> I'm basically going to wait for people who want to use this time to advocate for their modules, and do other work in the background as I wait. If no one shows in 15-20, we'll close.
18:06:05 <svg> Well, actually, I have a case for serverfull ansible....
18:06:41 <ryansb> svg: Isn't that just called...ansible
18:07:01 <svg> semantics!
18:07:28 <ryansb> so if folks have experience w/ Lambda, would love your thoughts on https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2558
18:07:50 <rbergeron> svg: wait, i think this reminds me of something on twitter yesterday :)
18:08:10 <svg> What's twitter?
18:08:12 <ryansb> And I have 2 (conflicting) PR's for NAT Gateway here: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/1882 and https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/1687
18:08:41 <ryansb> so if people have preferences between the approaches, please add comments or I'll have to flip coins
18:09:05 <gregdek> Ah, yes, I was supposed to resolve this. I'll do that now.
18:15:08 <gregdek> OK, I put a note into 1687 that we're considering preferring 1882 because it has tests, and I've asked them to join forces. We'll see where that goes, and it's definitely on next week's agenda.
18:19:02 <gregdek> All right, looks like no one is looking to advocate for a certain module, so I'm going to end today's meeting early -- and we'll not be having next week's meeting because of Ansible Employee All-Hands, so see everyone in two weeks!
