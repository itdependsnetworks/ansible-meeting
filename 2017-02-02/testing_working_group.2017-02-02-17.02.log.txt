17:02:17 <zodbot> The meeting name has been set to 'testing_working_group'
17:02:45 <mattclay> Do we have anyone here today, or is everyone traveling or otherwise engaged?
17:02:55 <sivel> I am here
17:03:09 <sivel> for what that is worth ;)
17:04:24 <mattclay> Anyone else?
17:05:24 <mattclay> Most folks that would have attended are probably busy at Ansible Automates Paris.
17:05:50 <mattclay> #topic Status Update
17:06:42 <mattclay> PEP 8 checks have been enabled as part of our CI process.
17:07:13 <mattclay> We are currently ignoring some PEP 8 checks for "legacy" files and enforcing a separate set of rules for new files.
17:08:09 <mattclay> Once the remaining legacy issues have been cleaned up, the new files rules will become the legacy list and a more strict set of PEP 8 rules will be used for new files going forward.
17:08:44 <mattclay> We're hoping to have this done in time for the start of development on the 2.4 release.
17:09:59 <mattclay> The bot has been updated to assist with keeping track of CI failures which are unrelated to PRs (temporary failures, failures due to failing tests in devel). However, the bot is currently down, so we can't make use of this new feature right now.
17:10:46 <mattclay> Issues labeled with `ci_verified` have been verified as being legitimate test failures. The bot will clear the label when new commits are added or when CI passes.
17:11:21 <mattclay> That's it for updates.
17:12:00 <mattclay> We have one topic on the agenda for discussion, but we'll save it for next week due to low attendance in today's meeting.
17:12:04 <sivel> I've submitted a PR to ensure that ANSIBLE_METADATA exists, and properly formatted
17:12:19 <sivel> additionally, the PR ensures that imports in modules come after documentation
17:12:41 <mattclay> sivel: Yes, thanks for that. I should be able to review that today and get it merged.
17:12:51 <sivel> cool, thanks
17:13:31 <mattclay> #topic Open Floor
17:14:04 <mattclay> Is there anything else to discuss?
17:17:13 <abadger1999> We added pytest-mock for unittests this past week.
17:17:26 <abadger1999> so people can use the mocker fixture in their unittests if they want.
17:19:02 <mattclay> abadger1999: It seems to be working well. Thanks for adding that.
17:20:00 <abadger1999> Thanks for making the pytest infrastructure... it has a lot of nice features compared to unittest+nose
17:22:22 <mattclay> It was a fairly easy change to make. I still need to convert the last of the yield tests to eliminate warnings about their deprecation.
17:25:36 <mattclay> Anything else? If not, I'll end the meeting in ~3 minutes.
