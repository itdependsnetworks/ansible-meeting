    need fixing in 2.5.* can be seen in

* Team updates  (gundalow, 16:20:37)
  * you may noticed that we've stopped doing daily standup status in
    here (#ansible-network). We didn't get much feedback, and we though
    that this was partly due to the bitty task-level updates. So we've
    decided to give weekly project updates in here, therefore they will
    end up in the IRC logs
    https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/sresults/?group_id=ansible-network&type=channel
    (gundalow, 16:22:31)

    16:22:58)
  * This covers the work for a new connection plugin for eAPI transport
    (Qalthos, 16:23:37)
  * This week I've been getting up to speed with Zuul, which is the CI
    framework that it used by OpenStack (and friends). For those that
    know about DCI (Distributed CI) this will be the *pre* commit
    replacement for that framework that allows us to test PRs against a
    varity of test machines, including those in partners labs. Nothing
    to currently demo or show, lots of learning how to glue parts
    together.  (gundalow, 16:25:47)
  * This week I'm revising end-user network documentation for 2.5. I
    also started a project for tracking documentation changes at
    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/projects/24 - if you have docs
    issues that I've not added to the project, please add them.

  * currently going through network-engine for template-engine and
