16:06:33 <samerd> could you explain please how to open, assign and close bugs?
16:07:15 <IPvSean> @samerd you open bugs with the ISSUES tab on github.com/ansible/ansible
16:07:56 <gundalow> samerd: Issues & PRs can only be assigned to people people with commit powers on ansible/ansible (which is generally Ansible Staff)
16:08:13 <gundalow> because of that, and to allow notifications we use https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml
16:08:22 <funzo> http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community.html#i-d-like-to-report-a-bug

16:08:32 <zodbot> Current chairs: IPvSean caphrim007 funzo gundalow privateip samerd
16:10:08 <samerd> @gundalow, @IPvSean: If I open a bug regarding my modules, is it assigned to me?
16:10:26 <gundalow> samerd: no, though Ansibot will notify you
16:10:48 <gundalow> samerd: example: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/34398#issuecomment-355040072
16:11:28 <gundalow> because: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml#L455
16:11:37 <gundalow> and https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml#L1201
16:12:35 <gundalow> along with BOTMETA.yml the `author:` field will be attempted to be parsed in the module
16:14:14 <samerd> @gundalow: thanks a lot, two other questions can I create a PR regarding this bug fix, and when this bug will be closed?
16:14:57 <gundalow> samerd: PR for?
16:16:41 <samerd> PR for fixing the bug
16:17:02 <gundalow> Sure. That directory is owned by you
16:17:07 <gundalow> Anyone can raise a PR
16:18:03 <gundalow> though your stamp of approval (shipit) will be needed if the change is to your files
16:18:44 <gundalow> e.g. lib/ansible/modules/network/mlnxos/ or your module_utils libraries
16:19:12 <samerd> gundalow: Great, Thanks so much for the clarification, and sorry for asking such basic questions.
16:19:40 <gundalow> samerd: I can assure you that everyone else has asked similar question before
16:20:01 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/blob/master/ISSUE_HELP.md explains the Ansibullbot workflow
16:20:54 <gundalow> samerd: You may wish to raise a PR to update BOTMETA.yml and add entries for lib/ansible/modules/network/mlnxos/ and whatever other directories you have (module_utils, plugins,etc)
16:21:11 <gundalow> And you can also list other people to be notified
16:22:05 <samerd> gundalow: thanks, I will check if anything need to be changed there.
16:22:19 <caphrim007> speaking of other people being notified gundalow
16:22:27 <caphrim007> is there a bug in the bot again?
16:22:30 <gundalow> Cool. Feel free to ping in here if you have any questions
16:22:45 <caphrim007> because i had people be notified in some prs which very clearly are marked no-notify in meta
16:22:47 <gundalow> caphrim007: https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/issues/837
16:22:58 <gundalow> ^ Don't set labels or mention people on broken merges
16:23:00 <gundalow> That issue?
16:23:24 <caphrim007> an example
16:23:25 <caphrim007> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/34207
16:23:39 <caphrim007> i dont think that one was busted at the time
16:24:29 <gundalow> oh, so wojtek0806 is listed in ignored
16:24:37 <caphrim007> yeah
16:24:38 <caphrim007> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml#L471
16:26:09 <gundalow> hum, which was added 4 months ago. I'll raise a bug now
16:26:12 <caphrim007> i seem to remember there being a former issue with ignores not working
16:26:23 <caphrim007> but i thought it was fixed/i havent been tracking it
16:27:42 <caphrim007> i'll have more prs over the next couple of days, so i'll see if it happens again
16:27:48 <caphrim007> if you want to forward the issue #
16:27:58 <caphrim007> i can list examples
16:28:07 <gundalow> caphrim007: https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/issues/840
16:28:32 <gundalow> If you see it again can you add a comment on the PR bot_status (comment by itself) that should give a bit more info
16:28:40 <caphrim007> ok
16:30:31 <gundalow> samerd: Any other questions?
16:32:02 <gundalow> samerd: I think we've reviewed all your PRs. The comment from trishnag on argspec may apply to multiple PRs, and possible some modules that have already been merged. If its easier to merge what we have then go back and raise one PR that fixes all the argspec issues in one go we can do that, otherwise feel free to update the PRs that are already in flight
16:35:27 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
