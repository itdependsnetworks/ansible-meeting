16:09:33 <Qalthos> #topic Lenovo PRs
16:10:14 <Qalthos> Anil_Lenovo: I merged them both, thanks as always for being responsive with your PRs
16:11:06 <Qalthos> Nothing else in the agenda today, so
16:11:11 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:11:37 <Federico87_> HellO! Happy new year guys! I have put in agenda PR ios_ntp module #50705 - probably is missed
16:11:51 <Federico87_> anyway, I have added the test required :)
16:13:19 <Qalthos> Federico87_: I don't see an open PR for that in the agenda, just the closed one from last month
16:13:25 <Qalthos> Are you talking about https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50705 ?
16:13:41 <Federico87_> Yeap!  that one
16:14:31 <Qalthos> Ah, looks like you put it on the wrong agenda
16:14:43 <Qalthos> #topic ios_ntp module
16:14:50 <Federico87_> Sorry, just back from holidays, my brain is struggling to get back on track :D
16:15:10 <Anil_Lenovo> Qalthos: I have seen that. Thanks a lot for merging and Wish u a prosperous New Year
16:15:51 <Qalthos> Federico87_: So you added tests, but they are failing
16:16:19 <Federico87_> So, I have added the test required, however pipeline is now failing. I have put some comemtns so would be great if someone can have a look. Considering that I have never written test and I have tried to revere engineering somithing similar
16:17:02 <Qalthos> Sure, give me a bit to take a closer look
16:17:12 <Federico87_> Thankyou very much!
16:18:28 <pabelanger> Qalthos: sorry for being late, I had somebody at door for a bit
16:18:38 <pabelanger> back now
16:19:33 <Qalthos> Federico87_: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50705/files#diff-f6b50283a1a1a05e6f099fef7b4b02a5R45 should just be load_config(), not a tuple of (0, load_config(), None)
16:19:43 <Qalthos> pabelanger: thanks
16:21:11 <Federico87_> ok, I' ll change it and see what s happen . I am still try to understand properly what the code is doing to be fair
16:23:43 <Qalthos> That line is an old artifact from how things used to work some time ago. Not entirely sure where you got it from, but it should no longer be necessary
16:24:22 <Federico87_> I have got it from an ios module...ios_logging probably
16:24:47 <Qalthos> #action Federico87_ fix ios_ntp unit tests and report back
16:24:52 <Qalthos> Moving on
16:25:00 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:25:22 <Qalthos> pabelanger: You should be able to take it from here
16:25:36 <pabelanger> Qalthos: ack, thanks again for starting
16:27:32 <pabelanger> We've be working on a zuul POC for 3pci over the last few weeks, we should be wrapping things up in the next week or two and decided how to proceed from it
16:28:07 <pabelanger> http://zw01.poctron.xyz is the web interface, but no jobs are configured yet
16:33:11 <pabelanger> and with that, lets wrap it up here. Thanks again Qalthos for driving
