16:00:32 <Qalthos> #topic Core Updates
16:01:45 <Qalthos> This week was not a role release week, so no new releases, though Ansible 2.7.6 should be here soon
16:02:14 <Qalthos> #info more work on integrating facts gathering
16:02:36 <Qalthos> #info fixes to vyos' get_config missing parameters
16:02:53 <Qalthos> #info nxos_install_os timeout fix
16:04:56 <Qalthos> #info refactor to config modules to allow specifying backup location
16:05:18 <Qalthos> And on that note
16:05:41 <Qalthos> #topic PR 50801
16:05:56 <Qalthos> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50801
16:07:23 <Qalthos> There don't appear to be a whole lot of people here this week, but this should get as many people looking at it as possible, as it touches a lot of platforms
16:09:36 <Qalthos> This adds `filename` and `dir_path` under `backup_options` to control where the backup file gets written.
16:10:36 <bcoca> i really wanted a 'global' feature and not just in networking ... but time/manpower/core buy in
16:11:14 <bcoca> even thought this is somethign awx/tower should do as it can then have  a central repo that fetches and stores the backups fro remote
16:13:07 <Qalthos> #action anyone with a _config network module review #50801 and raise concerns
16:17:20 <Qalthos> Okay, that is everything on the agenda for this week
16:17:26 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:18:30 <Qalthos> This meeting is pretty empty today, so if you have anything to bring up, feel free to do so
16:18:55 <Qalthos> Otherwise, I'll probably close this out early
16:20:35 <bcoca> close
