16:06:57 <gundalow> hum, doesn't appear to be anything new on the agenda
16:07:24 <gundalow> #info 2.5.0 RC1 is scheduled for 21st Feb
16:07:43 <gundalow> #info `devel` branch is 2.6, so that's unlocked for feature work
16:07:49 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:07:53 <gundalow> Anyone else got anything?
16:19:55 <IPvSean> would anyone mind if i put PRs in to make parameter names match across all modules?  I am curious how much trouble it would make for folks... also possible to make it backwards compatible..
16:19:55 <IPvSean> e.g. hostname vs host_name (vyos uses one, nxos uses another)
16:19:55 <IPvSean> domain-search vs domain_search
16:19:56 <IPvSean> name_servers vs name_server
16:22:09 <gundalow> IPvSean: you can add in aliases for them, you can't rename them
16:22:16 <gundalow> skg-net: Anil Hi, anything from you?
16:22:21 <gundalow> #chair skg-net Anil
16:22:21 <zodbot> Current chairs: Anil acozine1 gundalow rcarrillocruz skg-net trishnag
16:22:26 <Anil> Hi
16:22:33 <IPvSean> hi
16:22:38 <IPvSean> @gundalow makes sense
16:23:12 <Anil> I have nothing my side. I raised a PR for some clean up done in license informations
16:23:23 <gundalow> Anil: I think I merged that
16:24:02 <Anil> Wow.. Thank you
16:27:28 <gundalow> IPvSean: if you spot anything in devel that doesn't have both let me know
16:33:13 <gundalow> OK, will close the meeting shortly if there isn't anything else
16:33:34 <skg-net> gundalow:nothing from our side, test clean up and bugfix PR on works, will be coming in early next week.
16:36:17 <gundalow> skg-net: Ace. Just need to check that when we merge any PRs from you we also cherry-pick them into stable-2.5 as well
16:37:06 <skg-net> okay will mention the same in PR..
16:37:24 <gundalow> We generally remember, but we are only human :)
16:42:23 <skg-net> so the new modules can go in dev now?
16:42:32 <gundalow> skg-net: correct devel = 2.6
16:42:37 <skg-net> we are still working on the opx modules..
16:42:41 <gundalow> which is open for any community work
16:42:57 <skg-net> is it possible to tag them as preview for 2.5..
16:43:22 <gundalow> No new modules for 2.5 after community freeze
16:43:47 <skg-net> okay..
16:44:03 <gundalow> skg-net: anything else?
16:44:20 <skg-net> nope..thats it from our side..
16:44:35 <gundalow> COol
16:44:38 <gundalow> Thanks everyone
