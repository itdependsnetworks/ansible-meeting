    capture spec & discussion for larger blocks for work for 2.5
    (gundalow, 16:23:00)
  * Ideas for larger blocks of what that the Community has can also be
    raised as Proposals for consideration for Ansible 2.6+. I'd suggest

    timeout: at the top-level (i.e. not under `provider:`) will trigger
    a deprecation notice.  (gundalow, 17:05:11)

    (gundalow, 17:05:28)
