16:02:01 <pabelanger> #topic Core Updates
16:03:25 <pabelanger> People maybe have see an increase of activity on github issues, if you had one open. We've been going through the process of trying to prune the backlog of open issues.
16:04:31 <pabelanger> Specifically, we've been updating some issues asking for additional feedback from the OP. The key here, is if none is gathered the next state of said issues will likely be closed
16:05:04 <pabelanger> so, if you have open issues, and core team is asking for addional info, please do update them. Otherwise, we'll likely be closing them in a future date.
16:06:05 <pabelanger> #info If you have open issues, keep an eye out for request for feedback from core team
16:07:12 <pabelanger> Moving on, this week isn't a release week. So the team has been working on fixing bugs / new features for network roles at https://github.com/ansible-network
16:07:44 <pabelanger> A few examples are:
16:07:54 <pabelanger> #info Added hashed password support for ios_user
16:08:14 <pabelanger> #info Aggressive mode support to RHEL provider
16:08:39 <pabelanger> #info start work on adding provider for cisco firepower
16:09:03 <pabelanger> #info new provider role - frr under ansible-network with PR for frr_bgp module
16:09:50 <pabelanger> We are still planning next week to release new versions of our network roles.
16:10:55 <pabelanger> We also plan to send out announcements to twitter once we've tagged and imported it galaxy, you can follow along using: https://twitter.com/ansiblenetwork
16:11:31 <pabelanger> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/labels/network for todays items
16:12:19 <pabelanger> #topic PRs review request
16:12:38 <pabelanger> the only item we had was for https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/49467
16:12:54 <pabelanger> and that seems to be merged now, thanks Qalthos
16:13:14 <pabelanger> #topic Open discussion
16:13:35 <pabelanger> At this point, we can open the floor to any ad-hoc questions / comments
16:14:03 <pabelanger> otherwise, if none we'll close out this meeting early
16:14:32 <Anil_Lenovo> Nothing fromy side. Just want to convey my thanks to Qalthos
16:14:44 <mikewiebe> I have a list of PRs that have been merged over the past 15 days and I would like to see if we can get them cherry picked into 2.7
16:14:56 <mikewiebe> Should I just add a note requesting that to each?
16:15:38 <pabelanger> mikewiebe: yah, adding a comment on the meeting is a good start. Given there are 15, do you have an example of one?
16:16:02 <pabelanger> I'll have to defer to Qalthos on what the policy is to backport to 2.7 for network related PRs
16:17:41 <mikewiebe> pabelanger: They are all bug fixes for NX-OS.  Here is an example https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/49205/files
16:18:15 <pabelanger> #action pabelanger learn about backporting policy for network issues in ansible/ansible
16:19:05 <mikewiebe> pabelanger: I will add a note requesting they be cherry-picked and then work with Qalthos and trishnag on the details
16:19:14 <pabelanger> mikewiebe: okay, I would say lets add them to the meeting PR and I can follow up there about if / how to backport into 2.7.
16:19:26 <pabelanger> the good news, is that PR does have testing, which makes is a little safer IMO
16:19:33 <pabelanger> mikewiebe: Great, wfm
16:19:42 <mikewiebe> pabelanger: Sounds good.. adding them now
16:19:47 <pabelanger> thanks
16:23:23 <pabelanger> #action review backport request from mikewiebe: https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/363#issuecomment-444546695
16:23:58 <pabelanger> okay, if nothing else we can finish up and get back to our daily lives
16:24:02 <pabelanger> Thanks all
