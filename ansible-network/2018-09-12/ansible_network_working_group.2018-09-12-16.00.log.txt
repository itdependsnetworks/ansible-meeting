16:01:47 <Qalthos> #topic Core Team Updates
16:02:22 <Qalthos> #info 2.7rc1 went out last week, is available in the usual places
16:02:58 <Qalthos> As far as I know, rc2 is inbound soon, but I haven't heard anything specific
16:04:16 <Qalthos> We have a new team member, pabelanger, who will be taking over for some of gundalow's work and helping me run these meetings
16:05:04 <Anil_Lenovo> Where is Gundalow going ?
16:05:51 <pabelanger> hello!
16:05:58 <Qalthos> He's still here, just helping with more of the Ansible community than just networking
16:06:10 <rcarrillocruz> nowhere, he'll do community things, not just networking
16:06:22 <pabelanger> yup, gundalow still around, I'll be leaning on him a lot to get up to speed
16:06:27 <pabelanger> around networking
16:06:38 <Anil_Lenovo> oh ok. Great!
16:06:53 <Qalthos> Here are some of the things that the team has been working on this week:
16:07:25 <Qalthos> #info: * fixed a `nothing to repeat` issue with nxos terminal plugin on Python 2.6
16:08:03 <Qalthos> #info: * fixed multiple parents issue for asa
16:08:37 <Qalthos> #info * fixed issues with new firepower modules
16:09:01 <Qalthos> (bah, I hope those colons don't muck up the minutes)
16:09:14 <Qalthos> Moving on
16:10:10 <Qalthos> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/labels/network is where you can find the agenda, as always
16:10:54 <Qalthos> (It's getting a bit long, so when 2.7 is fully released, I'm probably going to close that and open a new one to kick off 2.8)
16:11:03 <Qalthos> #topic Lenovo PRs
16:11:39 <Qalthos> Anil_Lenovo: I merged the first one, and samccann is looking over the second, but I actually have one for you
16:12:06 <Anil_Lenovo> Qalthos: I have seen that. Thank you
16:12:39 <Qalthos> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45564 the cnos unit tests are leaving behind files that don't seem to be used in the tests themselves
16:14:31 <Qalthos> I'm not sure if `outputfile` can be removed here, but I was more surprised to find 'Anil.txt' in my source tree when I was fixing some unit tests today
16:15:08 <Anil_Lenovo> ok. will look into that I am remove any file creation logic. May have used it for Unit testing my unit tests, and may have missed out to remove
16:15:27 <Anil_Lenovo> Will clean up my code
16:16:32 <Qalthos> Anil_Lenovo: I think I got them all, if the files are not important for the tests, I can merge it now
16:17:12 <Anil_Lenovo> Sure. Go ahead !
16:17:20 <Qalthos> Anil_Lenovo: Excellent
16:17:41 <Anil_Lenovo> They are not important, just my bad I missed them out
16:18:14 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:18:41 <Qalthos> That takes care of the agenda, does anyone have any other topics they'd like to bring up?
16:23:03 <Anil_Lenovo> Nothing from me.
16:25:19 <Qalthos> Right, if nothing else shows up, I'll close at half past
16:29:58 <Qalthos> Thanks you for coming out. Have a good rest of your day!
