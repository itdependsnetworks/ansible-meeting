16:07:48 <gundalow> #info Agenda https://github.com/ansible/community/labels/network
16:08:43 <gundalow> #topic 2.5 update
16:09:26 <gundalow> #info `connection: network_cli` is LIVE. The issues with `authorize: true` (eos & ios) have been resolved
16:09:39 <gundalow> #info NO MORE `unable to open shell`
16:09:49 <gundalow> #info NO MORE `unable to open shell` even when using `connection: local`
16:10:03 <Anil> Great!
16:10:10 <gundalow> #action EVERYONE We'd really welcome testing on  the devel branch, this is a HUGE change
16:11:02 <gundalow> #info Error messages are show in ansible-playbook output: fatal: [vyos01.example.net]: FAILED! => {"msg": "host key mismatch for vyos01.example.net"}
16:11:27 <gundalow> st8less: jmcgill298 Anil We'd really welcome your feedback on this
16:11:52 <gundalow> #info NOTE: `connection: local` & `provider:` is still needed for eapi & nxapi
16:12:54 <Anil> So instead of local if i put network_cli, it will work .. am I right ?
16:12:59 <gundalow> correct
16:13:06 <Anil> in playbook
16:13:08 * gundalow is working on updated docs, one sec
16:13:12 <gundalow> will find example
16:13:24 <Anil> ok
16:13:31 <st8less> Sounds good, I'll definitely take a look.
16:14:05 <Anil> I will test it on enos modules tommorrow
16:14:15 <Qalthos> Caveat, if not in the set (eos,ios,iosxr,nxos,junos,vyos), there may be some action plugin tweaks needed
16:14:24 <gundalow> #info If you set `connection: network_cli` YOU MUST also set `network_os: $platform` (where platform is the three module prefix, e.g. eos, ios, nxos, vyos)
16:14:24 <Qalthos> I know some platforms have done that already
16:14:59 <gundalow> # Example inventory line: ios01.example.net ansible_connection=network_cli ansible_network_os=ios ansible_user=cisco ansible_ssh_pass=mypassword
16:15:03 <Anil> ok
16:15:55 <gundalow> Qalthos: ah, good point. Any other caveats?
16:16:55 <Qalthos> Not that I can think of. If it's one of those six, I fixed them myself, if not, there may be issues we need to work out
16:17:07 <Qalthos> Again, please test
16:17:13 <gundalow> :)
16:17:30 <gundalow> #info For general 2.5.0 status please see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/projects/10
16:18:17 <gundalow> #info Note that connection: (eapi, nxapi) are strech goals for 2.5 (that means there is lots of other stuff that needs doing before that, and it might end up in 2.6)
16:19:05 <gundalow> #info 2.5 Roadmap is live https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_5.rst
16:19:34 <gundalow> Any other questions on 2.5 or the connection work?
16:20:32 <Anil> I have one
16:20:37 <gundalow> Anil: Sure
16:21:03 <Anil> what will be the freeze date for our modules, in this context?
16:21:30 <Anil> 15 Jan right ?
16:22:20 <gundalow> Anil: yup
16:22:33 <gundalow> Note: that's the final date, we'd really like stuff to be in before hand
16:22:44 <Anil> Great Thanks
16:23:17 <gundalow> #info notes dates in ROADMAP_2_5.rst are FINAL dates, even PRs raised before hand are NOT guaranteed to get in. Sooner the better :)

16:27:44 <gundalow> bearrito: Hi, we are in "Open Floor", you got anything?
16:28:12 <bearrito> nope. thought i missed it again
16:33:58 <gundalow> Anil: st8less jmcgill298 Anything else for you?
16:34:14 <st8less> No, I'm good.
16:34:28 <jmcgill298> i'm good
16:34:37 <gundalow> Cool
16:35:10 <gundalow> Please do test the new connection work, the error messages alone should make it much more userfriendly
