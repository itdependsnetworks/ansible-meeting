16:02:19 <andriusb> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_8.rst
16:02:33 <andriusb> keep an eye on this page as it gets populated in the next week weeks
16:03:01 <andriusb> there are no agenda items so we will go to open floor
16:03:12 <andriusb> #topic Open Floor
16:05:26 <samccann> minor tidbit on networking docs - we did some batch backports to 2.7 but in general, can't keep up with all the devel PRs that have a docs impact. So recommendation is that if you have a doc PR, please backport if applicable to 2.7 at least.
16:05:49 <samccann> #info PR creators should be encouraged to backport to stable release when their PR is merged for PRs that improve/ are useful
16:06:33 <andriusb> yey thanks @samccann
16:07:19 <Anil_Lenovo> Qalthos: Yeah I would like to discuss regarding my PR #48154 which is a backport PR.
16:08:11 <Anil_Lenovo> Qalthos:You will be able to merge it for 2.7.2, right ?
16:09:13 <andriusb> #topic PR #48154
16:09:37 <Qalthos> Anil_Lenovo: I can't do a thing. The release manager for 2.7 will deal with it when they start merging PRs for the next point release
16:09:55 <andriusb> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/48154
16:10:28 <Anil_Lenovo> Qalthos: Now some how its green, thanks for the great help
16:10:40 <andriusb> #action Ansible 2.7 Release Manager will pick it up during the next z-release devel window
16:10:55 <Anil_Lenovo> cool thanks !
16:11:00 <andriusb> #action @Qalthos Ansible 2.7 Release Manager will pick it up during the next z-release devel window
16:11:19 <andriusb> #topic Open Floor
16:11:28 <Anil_Lenovo> In 2.8 Lenovo would like to change the following modules in tune with the existing modules pertaining to cnos_interface, cnos_vlan, cnos_portchannel
16:11:53 <Anil_Lenovo> I suppose the design of these modules is stable and will prevail right ?
16:11:58 <andriusb> #topic In 2.8 Lenovo would like to change the following modules in tune with the existing modules pertaining to cnos_interface, cnos_vlan, cnos_portchannel
16:12:21 <Anil_Lenovo> i mean xyz_vlan, interface and linkagg
16:13:44 <Anil_Lenovo> I may need an expert with whom i can clear doubts in case i need help. Qalthos will u be able to help me?
16:14:13 <andriusb> @Anil_Lenovo are you writing modules or roles
16:14:41 <Anil_Lenovo> modules only, I am changing my legacy modules to the same style of that of ios, eos etc
16:14:51 <andriusb> perfect, assuming as much just wanted to make sure
16:15:22 <andriusb> @Anil_Lenovo there are a lot of people out today (holiday) so we may not be able to pin you down the right person but we can make sure we get you someone who can help
16:16:30 <andriusb> #action @ikhan Assign appropriate expert to Anil_Lenovo for legacy module refactoring advice
16:16:37 <Anil_Lenovo> Thats ok. I will ping in this forum in case I need help. That time who ever is available can respond
16:16:50 <andriusb> I'll just make it an action item so it doesn't get lost
16:17:47 <andriusb> #topic Open Floor
16:18:02 <Anil_Lenovo> In addition to this , i have plans to add these roles, cnos-ospf, cnos_aaa, cnos-ntp, cnos_barebones
16:18:46 <Anil_Lenovo> So I asked in one previous meeting regarding process pertaining to add roles in the network segment
16:19:39 <andriusb> @Anil_Lenovo by "add roles" you mean to the distro? to galaxy?
16:19:56 <andriusb> do you have a namespace on Galaxy?
16:20:06 <Anil_Lenovo> to galaxy I think
16:21:01 <Anil_Lenovo> yes, we have already posted 6 roles there long back. But I came to know that for networking, there is going to be a separate section.
16:21:20 <andriusb> so you want to make a new namespace?
16:21:41 <andriusb> I see https://galaxy.ansible.com/lenovo
16:21:53 <Anil_Lenovo> No I want to get my roles included in the same network namespace
16:21:53 <andriusb> with roles for CNOS
16:22:10 <andriusb> unfortunately we won't be able to do that
16:22:27 <andriusb> unless you are saying adding a lenovo provider?
16:22:40 <andriusb> to https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network
16:22:54 <Anil_Lenovo> yes. same location
16:23:00 <Anil_Lenovo> I want to add there
16:23:15 <andriusb> we can work with you on the provider piece for sure
16:23:39 <Anil_Lenovo> Great!
16:24:02 <andriusb> as for networking roles / activities you'll notice more generic Roles there
16:24:11 <andriusb> see config_manager
16:24:38 <andriusb> #topic Lenovo would like to add a CNOS provider to ansible-network Galaxy
16:25:29 <andriusb> #action @ikhan @andriusb rocess for partner submissions
16:25:53 <andriusb> #action @ikhan @andriusb Provide process for partner provider submissions to ansible-network Galaxy
16:26:12 <Anil_Lenovo> As network CLIs are more or less vendor specific, the scope of generic solution, how are u addressing inter operability?
16:26:57 <andriusb> true, as you can see the current providers are leveraging cli_command and cli_config
16:28:08 <Anil_Lenovo> So in Roles, they provide vendor speecific CLI template and depending on vendor u choose template ?
16:28:35 <andriusb> you can take a look at the current working examples of the providers there: arista_eos, cisco_ios, cisco_iosxr, cisco_nxos, juniper_junos, vyos
16:28:47 <Anil_Lenovo> sure, I will do..
16:30:14 <samccann> also, as you find ..ahem... weaknesses in the documentation about roles, please do open a doc issue or doc pr to help us fill those voids
16:31:53 <Anil_Lenovo> yes, sure
16:32:52 <andriusb> good stuff
16:33:00 <andriusb> any other items?
16:33:10 <andriusb> #topic Open Floor

16:35:26 <andriusb> Going twice
