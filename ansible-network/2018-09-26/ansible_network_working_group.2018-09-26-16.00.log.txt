16:10:56 <pabelanger> Just a follow up to last weeks question about from Anil_Lenovo and uploading roles into ansible-network
16:11:05 <Qalthos> sure
16:11:19 <Qalthos> #topic External contributions to ansible-network
16:11:34 <pabelanger> we are still working on what that will look like moving forward, the steps on the ansible-network side to to come up with plan on how community members will use it / support roles there
16:11:54 <pabelanger> but is on the radar so expect more information to come
16:12:02 <Anil_Lenovo> Ok
16:13:07 <pabelanger> Qalthos: that's all I had
16:13:31 <Anil_Lenovo> We would also like to contribute there as roles. Will wait..
16:13:35 <Qalthos> pabelanger: Thanks for the update
16:14:03 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:15:18 <pabelanger> this week, I've been experimenting on adding more flavors to zuul in vexxhost. The idea here is, rather then using a 4vpcu VM to do things like linters / docs, we can downside that to a 1vcpu
16:15:23 <pabelanger> which is a cost savings
16:16:02 <pabelanger> we're also able to run jobs in a 2nd vexxhost region, vexxhost-sjc1, the main bonus we get now, is nested virt
16:16:16 <pabelanger> which will help for things like building our network images used by nodepool
16:16:46 <pabelanger> basically, now that this underlying infrastructure is in place, I plan on starting to automate some of our manual tests for ansible-network
16:17:00 <pabelanger> and help others start to use Zuul more for testing roles
16:26:12 <Qalthos> Alright, if no one else has anything to bring up, I'll close at :30
16:30:45 <Qalthos> pabelanger: Thanks for your updates
