16:18:58 <samerd> @gundalow: sorry for being late
16:19:35 <gundalow> samerd: It's all good, that's why we record. Was just saying that 2.5.0 RC1 will be cut today/tomorrow
16:20:57 <samerd> great, I am waiting for that.
16:21:10 <gundalow> I hope everyone has been testing devel/stable-2.5 :)
16:21:34 <gundalow> I don't see anything else on the agenda so...
16:21:37 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:23:14 <samerd> @gundalow: as branch devel/stable-2.5 has been created, is devel branch opened for new PRs (2.6)?
16:24:02 <gundalow> samerd: correct
16:24:44 <gundalow> #info devel is now for Ansible 2.6 work. This will NOT include any "supported: core" changes as the Ansible Core team will be using this release to focus on stability
16:25:19 <gundalow> We may create a stable-2.6 branch soon (in that case devel will become 2.7). More info to follow, keep an eye on the ansible-devel mailing list
16:25:40 <samerd> cool, thanks.
16:25:55 <samerd> will start preparing my new modules
