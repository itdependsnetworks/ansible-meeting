20:07:42 <cybette> can people hear us on bluejeans
20:07:54 <dmsimard> Shrews: ^
20:07:55 <Pilou> no
20:08:07 <Pilou> good :)
20:10:31 <Shrews> hard to hear monty
20:11:21 <Shrews> :-P
20:23:24 <dmsimard> bcoca: etherpad is https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ansible-summit-october-2018-zuul -- the "core" question we had was the first one in the pad about carrying patched modules, we're answering the question from someone in the room right now
20:25:37 <bcoca> msot of those dont seem as much 'forks' as 'disabled'
20:35:39 <bcoca> if they dont report quota correctly .. do they report billing correctly?
20:36:07 <bcoca> yes
20:36:24 <bcoca> mr glorious
20:36:44 <corvus> sorry over here :)
20:36:47 <bcoca> im sorry was there a question?
20:36:53 <corvus> there is about to be :)
20:37:00 <bcoca> ah, yes read that
20:47:28 <bcoca> cannot hear
20:51:09 <cybette_> bcoca: how about now?
20:51:21 <bcoca> better
21:02:02 <bcoca> i wish we could build that for roles
21:02:16 <bcoca> so users can have 'local patch' to external role and 'reapply on update'
21:03:02 <bcoca> but only systems i know do that are bsd ports/gentoo ebuilds
21:05:18 <Shrews> I am working on it now!
21:05:24 <Shrews> and failing!
21:05:30 <bcoca> not easy
21:05:46 <bcoca> both those systems require a 'version trailing patches'
21:06:16 <bcoca> so if you have a 2.3.1 patch you'll need a new one once 2.3.2 is out (most of the time)
21:16:14 <bcoca> i've spent 15yrs trying to forget perforce
21:16:42 <gundalow> General reminder, please ensure actions are being tracked with `#info` or on Etherpad
21:19:04 <ericsysmin> perforce was the best thing since sliced bread
21:19:07 <ericsysmin> haha
21:19:34 <bcoca> not imho
21:19:37 <ericsysmin> moved from it to github, luckily we didn't care about history or anything, we just wanted it to go away
21:20:03 <jlk> o/
21:20:07 <corvus> jlk: https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/developer/specs/container-build-resources.html#git-repo-sync
21:20:24 <corvus> jlk: the code blocks in that section seem to work
21:22:44 <jlk> corvus: ah right. I went down that path too, figuring out how to implement something for git that wasn't ssh, that was also terrible.
21:22:50 <jlk> I'm glad this works for what it does
21:23:08 <corvus> jlk: i mean, that's about all the testing i've done, but at least that much didn't not work :)
21:24:26 <jlk> lol truth
