16:06:02 <Qalthos> I don't see Anil here, so we can skip that for now
16:06:18 <Qalthos> #topic ios_ntp module
16:08:33 <Qalthos> Federico87_: I'm not really sure what the problem is, so I'm going to assume that I am failing to explain myself clearly
16:09:03 <Federico87_> Hello, I see there are 2 new comments so I still work on it. Hope will be good next time
16:09:36 <Federico87_> All good from your side. I am trying to understand how all the test work, how the files and fucntion are working together
16:09:38 <Qalthos> Your tests were not wrong or in need of changing... I'm looking for *more* tests added to what's there
16:10:22 <Federico87_> Do we have some kind of docs that says what test need to be done, what is required and how have to be done? Assuming a fair level of exeprience in python :)
16:10:38 <Qalthos> At the very least covering 1) setting configuration 2) changing configuration and 3) removing configuration for both unit and integration tests
16:11:24 <Federico87_> ok
16:11:27 <Qalthos> I'm not sure that we do, but I can have a look around
16:12:06 <Federico87_> That would be great because there are thinghs ar enot clear how they work in these test, reason why I am strugglin to get it right
16:13:04 <Federico87_> Anyway, I ll keep working on it, sooner or later I/we will sort it out!
16:13:08 <Federico87_> :)
16:14:17 <Qalthos> Federico87_: There is https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing.html which is a fine overview
16:14:27 <Qalthos> Federico87_: Also https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing_integration.html#network-tests
16:15:31 <Federico87_> I' ll have a look. Thanks for that
16:16:49 <Qalthos> Okay, I still don't see Anil, so that's the agenda taken care of
16:16:53 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:17:03 <Qalthos> Anyone have anything they'd like to bring up?
16:20:37 <Qalthos> Well, then everyone have a good week
