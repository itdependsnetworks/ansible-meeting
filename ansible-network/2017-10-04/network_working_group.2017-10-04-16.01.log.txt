16:03:42 <caphrim007> i thought this was still in ansible-meeting
16:03:57 <gundalow> caphrim007: Nah, moved here as we have bots in the Working Group channels now
16:04:18 * trishnag waves
16:04:34 <gundalow> Which has the bonus feature of allowing us to find minutes via https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/sresults/?group_id=ansible-network&type=channel
16:04:35 <caphrim007> yeah it was just brain fart on my part

16:06:21 <rcarrillocruz> caphrim007: i chatted with gundalow today and it seems you're interested on getting bigip integration tested, hoping we can chat about it
16:06:59 <gundalow> Right, going to start at the end of https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/247 and quickly go through the non-proposal stuff first
16:07:04 <caphrim007> rcarrillocruz: yeah we run integration tests in house right now, but i dont know how i need to change them for dist-io
16:07:17 <gundalow> #topic ansible/ansible#31202 ansible_net_neighbors
16:07:25 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31202
16:07:35 <gundalow> Question: Should we add cdp information to the lldp fact, since it is basically the same. We could add an attribute source in ansible_net_neighbors with value cdp/lldp ?
16:08:23 <gundalow> privateip: thoughts
16:08:38 * gundalow isn't sure how we are using ansible_net_neighbors
16:09:22 <privateip> +1
16:09:27 <gundalow> Cool, thanks
16:09:39 <seanx820> +1
16:09:51 <gundalow> #agreed Yes, add this to ansible_net_neighbors
16:10:27 <gundalow> #topic fortios_api
16:10:34 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/30767
16:11:50 <gundalow> Would be good to get some eyes on this
16:11:57 <gundalow> Anyone here use fortios?
16:11:58 <Gesha24> Just to clarify - that pull request is for 1 module out of about 20. And most of them don't really do much, besides documentation and feeding API endpoints to the API class

16:12:23 <gundalow> Gesha24: Hi, glad you could make it
16:12:56 <Gesha24> Hello. Sorry, I am very new to github and contributing code in general, so I am kind of not sure what/how to do
16:13:37 <gundalow> #action gundalow to review https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/30767
16:13:44 <gundalow> Other reviews welcome :)
16:13:58 <gundalow> #topic F5 PRs
16:14:47 <gundalow> #info Two new modules https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31205/files https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31207/files

16:14:58 <caphrim007> o/
16:15:11 <gundalow> caphrim007: Anything you need apart from us to review & merge?
16:15:37 <caphrim007> i dont think so. i was going to make a proposal on my soapbox related to a review that was done on one of them
16:15:53 <caphrim007> but maybe that's better left to a different audience
16:16:02 <caphrim007> core or testing or someone
16:16:11 <gundalow> regarding quotes in yaml?
16:16:22 <caphrim007> regarding yaml formatting and "opinions
16:16:36 <gundalow> Yup, that's a proposal, and not something that blocks this PR
16:16:56 <caphrim007> k
16:17:39 <gundalow> comment added to say it fine
16:18:00 <gundalow> caphrim007: I think the otehr comments are valid, once those are fixed it can be merged
16:18:13 <caphrim007> which pr was that?
16:18:41 <gundalow> Copy right notices on 31205
16:18:45 <gundalow> hum, they are not blocking
16:18:53 <caphrim007> that was also what i wanted to be in the proposal
16:19:05 <gundalow> 31205 merged
16:19:10 <caphrim007> maybe i missed the meeting where that was made a new requirement in module checklist?
16:19:12 <gundalow> I'll look at the others after
16:19:24 <gundalow> caphrim007: if it's not in dev_guide it's not a requirment
16:19:37 <gundalow> (or enforced by CI)
16:19:47 <gundalow> ok, onto the fun stuff now
16:19:56 <gundalow> privateip: Which would you like to attack first?
16:19:57 * funzo grabs popcorn
16:20:05 * seanx820 steals some popcorn
16:21:03 <privateip> 76 i suppose
16:21:12 <privateip> dag: you around?
16:21:25 <gundalow> #topic Refactor common network shared code into package
16:21:32 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/76
16:21:56 <privateip> just to update everyone
16:22:13 <privateip> the proposal as been amended (about 30 min ago)
16:22:48 <privateip> refactor to module_utils/network/common/ for common fuctions... module_utils/network/{{ platform }}/ for platform specific shared functions
16:23:20 <caphrim007> does {{ platform }} include the case where that platform is a directory of other stuff?
16:23:29 <caphrim007> or is that intended to be a single file
16:23:33 <privateip> directory
16:23:36 <caphrim007> k
16:23:50 <privateip> any nay's?
16:24:03 <privateip> dag commented in the proposal that he is good
16:24:17 <privateip> if no futher objections lets accept it and move forward
16:24:21 <caphrim007> so-long as there's not a networking company named "Common Networks"
16:24:23 <caphrim007> :-D
16:24:27 <privateip> LOL
16:24:30 <gundalow> haha
16:24:32 <rcarrillocruz> heh
16:24:32 * bcoca starts new company
16:24:51 <gundalow> too late, it already exists
16:24:52 <caphrim007> bcoca: i want 50% for coming up with that name :-P
16:24:58 <gundalow> though seems to just be an ISP
16:25:02 <gundalow> (anyways)
16:25:58 <gundalow> Will "ansible.module_utils.network" be a think, if so will it be empty?
16:26:01 <privateip> i think we have consensus
16:26:09 <privateip> gundalow: yes
16:26:13 * gundalow remembers some discussion/concerns about empty namespace
16:26:18 <gundalow> though I can't remember the detail
16:26:20 <bcoca> caphrim007: how much is 1/2 of 0?
16:26:27 <caphrim007> :p

16:30:07 * gundalow forgets how to use the bot
16:30:09 <Qalthos> there's no response for #agree
16:30:13 <gundalow> ah, OK
16:30:19 <gundalow> #agree ansible.module_utils.network.common - command shared functions
16:30:28 <gundalow> #agree ansible.module_utils.network.{{ platform }} - where platform is platform specific shared functions
16:30:32 <gundalow> privateip: Which is next?
16:30:50 <privateip> 71?
16:31:17 <Qalthos> #agreed ansible.module_utils.network.{{ platform }} - where platform is platform specific shared functions
16:31:27 <Qalthos> (not #agree, sorry)
16:31:35 <gundalow> #topic Aggregates (proposal#71)
16:31:45 <gundalow> #info https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/71
16:31:49 <gundalow> Qalthos: Thanks for fixing that
16:33:08 <privateip> bcoca: for 71, is loop_control: optimize: yes|no part of 2.5 roadmap?  if not, can it be?
16:36:25 <gundalow> I think bcoca has gone for lunch
16:37:14 <privateip> ok
16:37:24 <privateip> that is the current gating factor
16:37:41 <privateip> if we get loop_control: optimize: yes|no then the aggregates discussion is done
16:38:34 <privateip> the plan would be to refactor the "aggregates" to normal lists and use loop_control instead
16:38:50 <gundalow> #chair
16:38:51 <zodbot> Current chairs: Gesha24 Qalthos andriusb bcoca bdudas_ bearrito caphrim007 dt-arista funzo gundalow hbalaji jmcgill298 ktbyers ogenstad privateip rcarrillocruz skg-net trishnag
16:38:54 <gundalow> Thoughts ^
16:40:02 <jmcgill298> 71 generated a lot of discussion, I think it would be good to clearly lay out the proposed solution
16:40:13 <itdependsnetwork> ^^ agreed
16:40:26 <itdependsnetwork> I do not have a good handle on any these what people's position even is
16:40:34 <privateip> what is yours?
16:40:38 <privateip> position that is?
16:41:05 <privateip> i see this coming down to loop_control: optimzie: yes|no .... if we get that feature then we dont need aggregates
16:41:20 <privateip> if that ^^ is in 2.5 then we refactor aggregates in 2.6
16:41:37 <privateip> if not, then aggregates need to stay and we bikeshed on argument name
16:41:53 <ktbyers> My main question on this are what of mechanics on non-simple cases i.e. how aggregates is actually achieved.
16:41:58 <itdependsnetwork> That we need to define states that are well understood, and that the operational state should be a different dict
16:42:17 <ktbyers> For example, multiple levels of nesting or not a simple 'no'.
16:42:34 <ktbyers> But that is a different issue than the structure/loop-format/naming question.
16:42:43 <privateip> ktbyers: agreed
16:43:09 <privateip> i dont think we can discuss that until we know how we are doing loops
16:43:17 <ktbyers> Sounds good.
16:43:18 <privateip> either from the playbook or from an aggregates argument
16:43:49 <privateip> so as a status update, we are in holding pattern until we get the loop_control decision made
16:44:01 <privateip> gundalow: can we add that to core team irc meeting
16:44:12 <gundalow> sure
16:44:13 <privateip> see if we can get movement on this
16:44:16 <privateip> thanks
16:44:58 <gundalow> done
16:45:10 * gundalow and privateip have to leave in 15 minutes
16:48:40 <gundalow> What else does it make sense to go through today?
16:48:47 <itdependsnetwork> reading back through proposals, got them mixed up. Is purge on the table?
16:49:51 <privateip> once we get loop_control answered
16:50:49 <itdependsnetwork> So what is your complete proposal?
16:51:50 <privateip> get core to commit to loop_control: optimize: yes|no and then have a discussion around the mechanics as ktbyers said (purge would be part of that)
16:52:09 <privateip> its hard to discuss how we will purge until we understand how we will get the input
16:52:16 <jmcgill298> what proposal number is loop_control?
16:52:20 <privateip> 71
16:52:24 <privateip> oh sorry
16:52:47 <privateip> no proposal ... the PR is here --> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/30464
16:53:22 <privateip> jmcgill298: are you offering to write the proposal? :)
16:54:18 <jmcgill298> I'm just trying to get a clearer picture of what the solution would look like assuming loop_control is accepted
16:55:17 <privateip> need to undertand how the loop_control mechanims would work ... i have ideas but not fully vetted yet
16:55:26 <privateip> i think we are saying the same thing
16:55:44 <itdependsnetwork> that is what I am trying to understand, can you tell me your ideas in the world where you are the dictator
16:56:13 <itdependsnetwork> even if not fully vetted
16:57:11 <itdependsnetwork> Much easier for me to have the conversation where all sides are prescriptive in their intention, then can be broken into reasonable Y/N decision points
16:57:31 * gundalow has to ditch shortly
16:57:45 <privateip> normally yes but i have a hard stop in 3 minutes which isn't enough.... will try to compose my thoughts for next weeks meeting in a consumable format
16:57:53 <privateip> fair?
16:58:16 <itdependsnetwork> fair :)
16:58:40 <rahushen> quick question before we end the meeting... what's the timeline for 2.4.1 ?
16:58:53 <jmcgill298> agreed, would rather wait to have a fleshed out design
16:59:20 <privateip> rahushen: beta1 this week, rc1 next week
16:59:27 <privateip> current plan
16:59:44 <hbalaji> have been following the meeting. was wondering how and where do i start contributing. any guidance would be great :)
16:59:52 <rahushen> ok ...thanks for the info
17:00:49 <privateip> hbalaji: here is a good place to start --> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Anetworking
17:01:01 <privateip> tackle an issue or feature request
17:01:09 <privateip> we are all out here to assist if you have questions
17:01:27 <privateip> sorry all, i need to drop now ... thanks for your time today
17:01:29 <hbalaji> awesome
17:01:32 <hbalaji> Thank you
17:01:43 <seanx820> thanks
17:08:14 <Qalthos> Anything from anyone else before I close this meeting?
17:15:56 <Qalthos> Righto
