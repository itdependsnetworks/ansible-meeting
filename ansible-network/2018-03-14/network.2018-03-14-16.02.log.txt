16:04:40 <Qalthos> 2.5.0 is almost out

16:06:12 <Qalthos> Not much on the agenda today
16:06:20 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:06:51 <Anil_> I have one question to ask, May I ?
16:06:59 <Qalthos> Anil_, sure
16:07:31 <Anil_> When its likely to have our 2.5 GA, any tentative date ?
16:07:54 <andriusb> @Anil_ probably a few more weeks
16:08:20 <Anil_> Oh.! how many PRs are still pending ?
16:08:56 <andriusb> Anil_ if you have a specific one, please share it. The release is pretty locked down now for testing.
16:10:52 <Anil_> ok.. thats fine. My Manager is curious and keep on asking me these. So just asked it here. No issues
16:11:15 <andriusb> Anil_ sure thing, you know how open source releases go! :-)
16:11:59 <Qalthos> Anybody have anything else?
16:13:11 <mikewiebe> Will there be a specific cadence for dot releases in 2.5?  The reason I ask is that we have some upcoming fixes that *might* need to be added to future 2.5 dot releases.
16:13:13 <samerd> @Qalthos: I just wanted to ask about the procedure of bug fixes
16:14:08 <samerd> bug fixed now, in which version will they be included?
16:17:12 <Qalthos> samerd: when it gets to devel, it will be in the next release. If it gets determined to get picked into an existing release branch, then it goes out with the next point release
16:17:41 <Qalthos> so your bug is marked as needing to get picked for 2.5.1, which is when it will likely show up
16:18:18 <samerd> Qalthos: Thanks for the explanation
16:18:47 <Qalthos> mikewiebe: I'm not entirely sure, the release schedule is not a thing I've been paying enough attention to, apparently
16:19:13 <Qalthos> if no one else here can answer that, #ansible-devel should know
16:19:58 <mikewiebe> Qalthos: Thanks, no worries.  I will ask on #ansible-devel
16:20:47 <Qalthos> Anyone else have anything to discuss?
16:29:18 <Qalthos> Right, then
16:29:31 <andriusb> going once
16:29:38 <andriusb> going twice...
16:29:46 <funzo> thanks Qalthos
16:30:02 <Qalthos> And thanks to everyone who showed up
