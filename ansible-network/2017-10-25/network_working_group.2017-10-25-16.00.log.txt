16:14:04 <gundalow> Hi :)
16:14:13 <gundalow> Anil: No problem :)
16:14:25 <Qalthos> I'm drafting a reply for 28939, but 29030 is merged
16:14:31 <gundalow> #info Integration Tests only: nxos_udld, nxos_udld_interface, nxos_vxlan_vtep_vni https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/29143
16:14:43 <rahushen> Just wondering if you need something from our end to get the tests integrated
16:14:50 <gundalow> #info Integration Tests only: add static route, snmp_user, snapshot and hsrp it cases https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/28933
16:15:22 <gundalow> #info Tests have been updated to include proper titanium condition & nxapi exclusion
16:15:29 <gundalow> Which I believe was the last blocker
16:15:42 <Qalthos> Hopefully not. It looks like there's an NXOSv issue for nxos_gir_profile_management, and 29143 is next to go
16:16:02 <gundalow> trishnag: Qalthos Would be good to get these tested again
16:16:19 <gundalow> I assume the tests will be cherry-picked into `stable-2.4` as well
16:16:21 <Qalthos> gundalow: Literally doing that as we speak, that's been my morning
16:16:34 <gundalow> ah, cool
16:16:36 <gundalow> Qalthos++
16:16:39 <zodbot> gundalow: Karma for qalthos changed to 1 (for the f26 release cycle):  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/tags/cookie/any
16:17:01 <Qalthos> yay?
16:17:09 <gundalow> erm
16:17:10 <gundalow> OK
16:17:11 <gundalow> moving on
16:17:26 <gundalow> Qalthos: rahushen Anything else on NXOS?
16:18:09 <Qalthos> not from me

16:18:13 <rahushen> had 3 PRs that got merged into devel, but didn't make 2.4.1. Did I miss the deadline for 2.4.1 ?
16:18:27 <Qalthos> rahushen: which ones?
16:19:00 <Qalthos> trishnag: ^
16:19:11 <rahushen> #31261, #31259
16:20:08 <rahushen> #31057
16:20:13 <gundalow> #info We are using GitHub projects to state what should be considered for 2.4.x backport. The project is listed under labels & milestones on the right hand side of the PR. If you think anything should be backported please let us know
16:20:55 <rahushen> I'm wondering if these can be squeezed in with 2.4.1 rc3 if there will be one
16:21:44 <trishnag> rahushen: these PRs were merged late. the fixes are waiting on to be cherry-picked on 2.4 https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31682
16:21:48 <Qalthos> rahushen: All of those are tracked in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31682, and trishnag has replied to all of those issues with the current situation
16:22:23 <rahushen> I understand
16:23:27 <Qalthos> It'll get in 2.4.1 if it can, but I wouldn't be too surprised if they don't
16:23:58 <rahushen> Qalthos: thanks!!
16:25:24 <Qalthos> rahushen: mikewiebe anything else?
16:25:39 <rahushen> Nothing from me
