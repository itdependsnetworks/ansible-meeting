16:02:49 <Qalthos> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/labels/network is where you can find the agenda as always
16:03:27 <Qalthos> That being said, there was only one item on the agenda, and I took care of it before the meeting, so...
16:03:33 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:09:09 <Anil_Lenovo> Qalthos : Regarding PR#48154, I am still working on it.
16:10:41 <Qalthos> Anil_Lenovo: Do you have any questions about what we want from you?
16:11:22 <Anil_Lenovo> Well, The new addition of switch is the bottle neck there.
16:12:08 <Anil_Lenovo> The issue with me is that the switch will be out in market by Dec 15 and Ansible 2.8 will come out may be 2 months after that
16:13:19 <Anil_Lenovo> At the moment, for CNOS modules there is a default rule file, which will work on switch
16:14:16 <Anil_Lenovo> Few attributes like speed and number of ports are the only issues.. I hope no customers of Lenovo will try them out for the 2 months window
16:15:13 <Anil_Lenovo> This week, I will be changing cnos_vlan in similiar lines to ios_vlan , eos_vlan etc
16:15:35 <Anil_Lenovo> Qalthos : If time permits, please review them
16:16:12 <mikewiebe> Qalthos:  Thanks for merging https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/47944
16:16:25 <Qalthos> Anil_Lenovo: Will do when I see them
16:16:34 <Anil_Lenovo> Thanks.
16:17:20 <Qalthos> mikewiebe: Thanks for giving me such an easy PR to review (:
16:20:18 <mikewiebe> Qalthos: np! ( :
