16:14:13 <zodbot> Current chairs: Anil Qalthos andriusb funzo ganeshrn gundalow gundalow_ jmcgill298 kedarX samerd thaller__

16:16:36 <gundalow> #chair Dustin
16:16:36 <zodbot> Current chairs: Anil Dustin Qalthos andriusb funzo ganeshrn gundalow gundalow_ jmcgill298 kedarX samerd thaller__
16:17:10 <samerd> Dustin: I am adding support only for mlnxos
16:17:34 <Dustin> ah ok
16:18:26 <gundalow> Dustin: I see modules for ospf for nxos
16:19:05 <Dustin> but thats only supported with nxos api
16:19:39 <Dustin> that requires nsox 7.3 and higher unless something changed
16:21:19 <gundalow> Not aware of anything changing there
16:21:48 <gundalow> Dustin: Feel free to create a feature request: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/new
16:22:00 <gundalow> Not going to be done for 2.5, though we can look at it for 2.6
16:22:39 <Dustin> ok thanks
16:24:39 <gundalow> Anil Dustin Qalthos andriusb funzo ganeshrn gundalow gundalow_ jmcgill298 kedarX samerd thaller__ Anything else/
16:26:37 <Dustin> no thats all i have
16:28:01 <gundalow> Cool
16:28:03 <gundalow> Anyone else?
16:28:05 <itdependsnetwork> Qalthos: did you get a chance to look at comments on: 34101
16:28:42 <Qalthos> itdependsnetwork: not yet, but I will get to that soon
16:28:46 <itdependsnetwork> This PR seems from a distance, problematic
16:28:50 <itdependsnetwork> ok
16:29:44 <samerd> gundalow: I have general question about network devices.
16:29:55 <Qalthos> itdependsnetwork: I actually agree with that, which is why I haven't moved more rpidly on that
16:29:56 <gundalow> samerd: Sure, go for it
16:30:13 <samerd> Are there modules for SW or image upgrade?
16:30:28 <gundalow> SW?
16:30:45 <samerd> Software
16:30:48 <gundalow> oh, updating the switch OS
16:30:52 <gundalow> I think NXOS have one
16:31:05 <gundalow> nxos_install_os.py
16:31:34 <ganeshrn> samerd: also junos_package module
16:31:52 <gundalow> nxos_install_os.py: Install an operating system by setting the boot options like boot image and kickstart image and optionally select to install using ISSU (In Server Software Upgrade).
16:32:41 <samerd> gundalow: Thanks a lot, If I have time I may add one for mlnxos
16:32:51 <gundalow> Also cnos_image.py
16:33:00 <gundalow> #chair skg-net
16:33:00 <zodbot> Current chairs: Anil Dustin Qalthos andriusb funzo ganeshrn gundalow gundalow_ jmcgill298 kedarX samerd skg-net thaller__
16:33:20 <Anil> Yes, I have added modules for config backup and upload as well
16:33:47 <Anil> but thats utilizing cli commands internally
16:34:02 <samerd> ganeshrn: Thanks, I will take a look
16:34:05 <Anil> and u need to have a SFTP/FTP/SCP server also
16:35:59 <gundalow> samerd: again, watch out for cut of dates for modules#
16:36:06 <gundalow> :)
16:36:13 <samerd> Anil: sure, the OS will be uploaded via scp
16:36:56 <samerd> gundalow: sure I am aware of that, and the module will be added only I finished by time
16:37:22 <gundalow> samerd: sorry, I go into repeat mode in the lead upto module/feature freeze :)
16:37:35 <Anil> samerd : take a look at code there, any doubts shoot a mail at amuraleedhar@lenovo.com
16:38:38 <samerd> Anil: Thanks, I'll do
16:40:04 <gundalow> caphrim007: You got anything else?
16:41:29 <gundalow> Will close the meeting shortly if not
16:41:35 <ganeshrn> Anil: how is backup directory creation handled in enos_config module?...asking because i can't see enos_config.py action plugin
16:41:41 <ganeshrn> backup and src options are handled in <platform-name>_config.py action plugin for other platforms
16:44:35 <Anil> ganesh: my cnos code is pretty old and its directly using paramiko. So it dont have the latest design conventions . I will modify CNOS to latest styles in 2.6
16:45:50 <Anil> Ganesh: The logic is simple, u invoke the CLI for image upload using paramiko and provide attributes in that CLI as variables
16:46:22 <skg-net> gundalow: we will be submitting PR to support network_cli for dellos* modules shortly
16:46:34 <ganeshrn> i am asking about enos_config module (not related to earlier discussion)
16:46:34 <gundalow> skg-net: Ace
16:47:29 <ganeshrn> Anil: the module doc states if backup is set to true " The backup file is written to the C(backup)
16:47:29 <ganeshrn> folder in the playbook root directory."
16:47:42 <Anil> ganesh: at the moment I have created it manually
16:48:05 <ganeshrn> ah ok
16:48:28 <ganeshrn> i think right approach would be to handle it in enos_config.py action plugin
16:48:31 <skg-net> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32507
16:48:46 <Anil> May be I should mention it in documentation or should add create folder logic..
16:49:07 <Anil> ganesh : I will take it as an action item on me
16:49:18 <ganeshrn> Anil: cool thanks
16:50:51 <skg-net> for the above issue we handled multiple prompts we have changed prompt and answers to be list instead of string and handled in the common code.
16:51:44 <skg-net> we can create a PR for the same, we were not able to validate the other platforms.
16:52:27 <skg-net> is there way we can validate it or just running the unit test cases is sufficient
16:55:55 <skg-net> gundalow:??
16:56:28 <gundalow> skg-net: Changed the prompt in which file?
16:56:40 <gundalow> Dell specific, or common across multiple platforms?
16:56:52 <ganeshrn> skg-net: changing prompt and answers to list in network_cli will be a breaking change for other platforms
16:56:56 <skg-net> common across all platforms
16:57:31 <skg-net> it can take both list and string..
16:58:24 <skg-net> to make sure we have backward compatible..
16:58:55 <skg-net> we will raise a PR, take a look at the changes and let us know..
17:01:36 <gundalow> cool
17:01:40 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
