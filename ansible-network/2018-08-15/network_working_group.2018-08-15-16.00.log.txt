16:01:50 <gundalow> A lot of the team is out today due to national holidays
16:01:56 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:06:41 <lrichardson> how much time is there for getting new work into 2.7? If https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/43902 makes it, I'm wondering how much time there might be for additional modules before the cutoff.

16:11:59 <gundalow> lrichardson: Hi. I think that's good to merge
16:12:17 <gundalow> What other modules are you thinking of?
16:12:38 <lrichardson> exos_interface, exos_vlan would be most likely
16:14:05 <gundalow> lrichardson: Ah, cool, I'd hope that wouldn't be *too* much work to get in as we have existing modules
16:14:36 <gundalow> `2018-08-30 Community Freeze (Non-Core Modules/Plugins)` from https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_7.rst#expected
16:16:22 <lrichardson> OK, thanks, I was just looking at that and wondering if "community freeze" was the applicable date
16:18:55 <gundalow> lrichardson: Any suggestion on how we can make that clearer?
16:20:19 <lrichardson> I think it's good as-is, I had only a small doubt
16:20:57 <gundalow> lrichardson: OK :)
16:21:19 <gundalow> lrichardson: Feel free to mention the PRs directly in this channel once they've been raised
16:21:41 <lindsayhill_> I have open PRs for nos_facts (#44094), nos_config (#44140), and an slxos_config fix (#44103). Plan to submit voss_facts & voss_config in next week.
16:22:14 <lindsayhill_> Should give time for review before cut-off date. Don't think I'll do any more modules for NOS/VOSS/SLX-OS in 2.7 though

16:23:24 <gundalow> lindsayhill_: Yup, that sounds sensible. Thank you for all of those
16:23:37 <gundalow> You all aware of AnsibleFest & Contributors Summit?
16:23:49 <lindsayhill_> gundalow: Thanks for the reviews so far
16:26:59 <lrichardson> I was looking at the AnsibleFest and Contributors Summit info this morning... looks interesting but I'm not sure I'll be able to attend.
16:28:20 <gundalow> lrichardson: Sure, just so you are aware Contributors Summit is also available via IRC & video call
16:30:18 <lrichardson> gundalow: good to know, I'd be interested in that
16:30:44 <lindsayhill_> I will do IRC/video at minimum, but will try to figure out way to get there in person
16:31:10 <lindsayhill_> Don't have same boss as lrichardson, but ultimately comes out of the same budget further up the chain :)
16:31:21 <lrichardson> :)
16:59:16 <gundalow> Thanks all
