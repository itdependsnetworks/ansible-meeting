16:08:57 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:09:00 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:10:35 <lindsayhill_> Only other comment from me is: thanks for merging the exos_facts and  voss_command modules
16:11:13 <lindsayhill_> and hopefully soon nos_command - then I'll submit PRs for more Extreme NOS modules (nos_facts, nos_config). I'll also do a networking platform docs update for Extreme NOS & VOSS
16:11:31 <rcarrillocruz> yw ;-)
16:13:38 <gundalow> lindsayhill_: They look good. Wonder if `voss` should be added to https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_index.html
16:14:32 <lindsayhill_> Yes - I will do a docs update for that some time in the next few days
16:15:32 <gundalow> Yup, getting the code in is higher priority. We can take docs fixes upto the last release candidate
16:15:57 <gundalow> Important so people know about the cool stuff that's been added :)
16:16:32 <lindsayhill_> Good to know that docs updates can go in later if needed. Still want to get it done before RC stage
16:16:50 <gundalow> lindsayhill_: You aware of https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/247#issuecomment-410042603

16:22:48 <gundalow> hi Anil_Lenovo anything from you?
16:23:57 <lindsayhill_> gundalow: Maybe. Will need to do some negotiation with the boss.
16:25:31 <Anil_Lenovo> No I dont have anything

16:27:51 <gundalow> Anyone got some cycles to look into this?
