16:19:17 <gundalow> Anyone got anything?
16:19:56 <samerd> Hi gundalow
16:21:30 <gundalow> Hi
16:21:43 <gundalow> Nothing on the agenda, so if anyone has anything feel free to speak up
16:21:50 <gundalow> samerd: How you getting on?
16:22:40 <samerd> gundalow: every thing is going fine, I had a break last week, and got back this week
16:22:56 <samerd> I pushed another module yesterday
16:23:19 <samerd> after merge I will push the rest of the modules
16:23:36 <samerd> I just need to write some unit-tests
16:24:32 <Anil> Can i discuss some thing related to ansible command and its usage with lenovo enos device ?
16:24:40 <gundalow> Anil: Sure
16:25:20 <Anil> When I tried this command
16:25:22 <Anil> root@SSRB-Ansible:/home/ansible/sheru/ansible# ansible enos -m raw -a "show sys-info" 10.241.105.24 | FAILED | rc=-1 >>  Lenovo RackSwitch G8272
16:25:37 <Anil> ansible enos -m raw -a "show sys-info"
16:26:02 <Anil> I get result as 10.241.105.24 | FAILED | rc=-1 >>
16:26:11 <Anil> While i tried like
16:26:47 <Anil> inventory file looks like this
16:26:56 <Anil> [enos] 10.241.105.24    ansible_connection=paramiko ansible_ssh_user=admin ansible_ssh_pass=admin
16:27:29 <Anil> when I put connection = paramiko it succeeds
16:27:34 * ganeshrn waves
16:27:40 <Anil> I mean it fetches data
16:28:22 <Anil> but when I put raw or network_cli or local. It fails
16:28:50 <gundalow> Anil: Have you updated the modules to support network_cli?
16:29:15 <Anil> yes.. Its working now as network _cli only
16:29:32 <gundalow> Generally you should get a message when you use a connection other than local or network_cli telling you to use the correct connection type
16:30:11 <Anil> yes. But network_cli is not in list for ansible command
16:30:25 <Anil> not even local
16:30:45 <Anil> only raw, shell and paramiko are supported
16:31:25 <Anil> Any one tried to configure a one liner CLI using ansible command ?
16:32:22 <gundalow> ansible -m vyos_command -a 'commands=?' -u vyos -i vyos-1-1-0, -e 'ansible_host=ec2-34-232-64-116.compute-1.amazonaws.com ansible_port=22 ansible_connection=local ansible_ssh_private_key_file=test/cache/id_rsa' vyos-1-1-0
16:32:26 <gundalow> I've done things like that before
16:33:32 <Anil> yes..thats not working now, may be only for lenovo switches
16:33:44 <Anil> I just wanted to know correct usage
16:35:00 <ganeshrn> Anil: is there a action plugin for enos modules
16:35:17 <Anil> yes.. its there..
16:35:25 <ganeshrn> generally connection=local for network modules is handled in action plugin
16:36:18 <ganeshrn> ok
16:36:54 <Anil> ok.. I will try that way.
16:36:58 <gundalow> Anil: I'd ignore raw, not sure if that would be the right thing anyway
16:38:09 <Anil> so this concept of action plugin etc works for not only for ansible-playbook command but also for ansible command too.. right
16:38:25 <bcoca> yes
16:38:44 <Anil> I will put debug logs and try then..Thanks for giving me pointers
16:38:44 <bcoca> it works for 'tasks' does not matter if you run from ansible/ansible-playbook/ansible-console
16:39:15 <Anil> when u make a one liner command with ansible.. there is no tasks there
16:41:39 <Anil> In case u guys can try out one "show run" command and post it to me.. it will be realy helpful
16:48:28 <Anil> Ok.. Thats all. You can continue with other topics
16:49:52 <gundalow> Don't think there is anything else
16:50:08 <gundalow> Anil: Could you please ping me an email and I'll reply with details later
16:50:13 <gundalow> so I don't forget
16:50:17 <gundalow> Thanks everyone
