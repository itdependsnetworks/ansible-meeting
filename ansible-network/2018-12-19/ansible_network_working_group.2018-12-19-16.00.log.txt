16:03:37 <Qalthos> #info Ansible 2.7.5 was released last Thursday
16:03:58 <Federico87_> if someone can have a look so we can merge (?)

16:05:39 <Anil_Lenovo> Thats just got added
16:05:55 <Anil_Lenovo> i completed few minutes back only
16:06:04 <Anil_Lenovo> You may skip it for later

16:07:36 <Qalthos> #topic new ios NTP module
16:07:59 <Qalthos> Federico87_: I am assuming this is yours
16:08:16 <Federico87_> Ok, I believe is my turn. Sorry gusy, I am fairly new for in this thinghs :D
16:08:46 <Qalthos> So the biggest thing I see immediately is that there are no  tests
16:08:47 <Federico87_> I have raised a PR for that. All checks are passed. I have also provided some validation test
16:08:54 <Federico87_> not sure what the next tep will be
16:09:14 <Federico87_> ah ok..., so how this test have to be submitted?
16:10:29 <Qalthos> So, (simply because it's handy) at the end of the cnos_banner PR (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50145/files) you can see new files added to test/units/modules/network/
16:11:49 <Qalthos> You would want to add unit tests there under test/units/modules/network/ios and integration tests to test/integration/targets/ios_ntp
16:11:56 <Federico87_> ok, I ll have a look and trying to figure it out. Thanks for that
16:12:44 <Qalthos> the tests for nxos_ntp might be a good starting place if the modules are similar enough
16:13:22 <Qalthos> #action Federico87_ add tests to ios_ntp PR
16:13:36 <Federico87_> sure, thanks!
16:14:11 <Federico87_> I won't be availble untill 6th Jan thouhg, so I ll be able to have a look once back
16:14:40 <Qalthos> Well neither will I
16:14:46 <Qalthos> Oh, and speaking of which
16:14:57 <Qalthos> #topic Core Updates pt. 2
16:15:44 <Qalthos> #info This will be the last network IRC meeting of the year.
16:16:02 <Qalthos> Probably the next one will be the... second?
16:16:08 * Qalthos consults a calendar
16:16:46 <Qalthos> Yes, the second of January is likely the next IRC meeting, though I won't be the one running it
16:17:45 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:18:29 <Qalthos> Now that I've remembered to say that, does anyone have anything else to bring up?
