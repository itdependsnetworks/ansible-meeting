16:01:51 <Qalthos> #topic Updates from Core
16:02:13 <Qalthos> #info 2.6rc1 has been released
16:02:21 <Qalthos> it can be found in the usual places
16:05:01 <Qalthos> We're hoping rc2 will be good enough to release, so if there's something vital for 2.6.0, get that in now
16:05:06 <Qalthos> Speaking of which
16:05:40 <Qalthos> Agenda has all been taken care of, so
16:05:46 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:07:06 <Anil> can any one send the link to RC1
16:07:08 <Anil> ?
16:07:35 <Anil> my test team want to test against that
16:07:49 <bcoca> http://releases.ansible.com/ansible/ansible-2.6.0rc1.tar.gz
16:08:22 <Anil> bcoca: Thank you!
16:09:18 <Qalthos> Also available on PyPI as ansible==2.6.0rc1, if you prefer
16:09:49 <bcoca> also, we tag the repo so you can point at that
16:09:54 <Qalthos> lots of options
16:10:10 <Anil> Great !
16:12:18 <Anil> Lenovo test team may insist on Coverity scan and Security Review inputs on my modules, which i may have to fix subsequently
16:12:18 <Qalthos> If no one has anything else to talk about, this'll be a nice, short meeting
16:12:55 <Anil> When is RC2 planned? I just want to know much time I have to fix those issues
16:14:40 <bcoca> 1st rc is 5 days, subsequent ones are 2
16:15:26 <Anil> ok..which means on next tuesday/wednesday ?
16:16:01 <merlincorey> I just wanted to confirm that I have started work on the network_cli compliant plugins/modules for fortios devices
16:16:38 <merlincorey> and I do have another silly question - just want to confirm that it's okay to make pull requests from any random branch on my repo or if you want me to merge it into devel before making a pull request or anything like that
16:16:44 <merlincorey> just curious on protocol basically
16:16:56 <merlincorey> also I am working against devel so I am working on 2.7.0 not 2.6.0, so no worries there
16:17:40 <Qalthos> merlincorey: Any random branch is fine, just make sure it applies cleanly on top of devel
16:17:48 <merlincorey> perfect thank you :)
16:18:17 <Qalthos> merlincorey: GitHub and/or ansibot will yell at you if something goes wrong, but should give you an idea of how to fix it
16:19:25 <merlincorey> sounds good, hopefully will be pretty straightforward for everyone
16:19:42 <merlincorey> I'm more or less using the cisco ios plugins/modules as a guide, as directed to me last week
16:22:30 <Qalthos> Well, keep us posted if you run into any issues
16:22:35 <Qalthos> Anyone else?
16:29:11 <Qalthos> Right, then. Thanks everyone for coming
16:29:23 <Anil> Thanks
