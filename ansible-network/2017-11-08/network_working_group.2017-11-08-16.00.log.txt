16:03:43 <itdependsnetwork> hi
16:04:05 <jmcgill298> hello
16:04:31 <gundalow> #info Agenda as always https://github.com/ansible/community/labels/network
16:05:11 * Qalthos ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ
16:05:46 <gundalow> #topic Docs
16:05:54 <gundalow> Any final feedback on https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31807 ?
16:06:41 <gundalow> Based on discussion of `~` just now on NTC Slack I wonder what else may need doing around filters, yaml and jinja 2
16:07:34 <gundalow> I was considering as the first step that the replacement for http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_networking.html would have links to the Jina & filters section
16:08:09 <st8less> There are a lot of splinter topics that arise from an intro doc.  I think keeping it fairly concise is a good idea.  Maybe add a section near the bottom for "Further reading" or "Intermediate techniques"?
16:08:38 <gundalow> st8less: ah, yes, good clarification. I don't want to document them on that page, though as you said, link to the pages with the details on
16:08:47 <gundalow> and where needed flesh out the specific pages
16:08:55 <st8less> Exactly
16:09:15 <gundalow> such as link to and improve docs/docsite/rst/YAMLSyntax.rst
16:09:41 <st8less> As mentioned in the comments, there are tons of vendor-specific tools, techniques, and gotchas.  Best to document them separately IMO.
16:09:42 <gundalow> That will need to be a collective effort
16:11:06 <itdependsnetwork> perhaps in the recap re-show the task(s) you are referring to?
16:12:20 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: interesting idea. Maybe I shouldn't have the code as one block. Instead it should be: few lines of Playbook + description of above. Next section of playbook + description
16:13:04 <itdependsnetwork> I like it all in one spot, people want to copy and paste it, but may make sense to do one before the other
16:13:13 <itdependsnetwork> e.g. have both :)
16:13:15 <gundalow> aye, copy & runnable was my idea
16:13:44 <gundalow> hum, well if that's the only feedback that's left then I guess it's good to merge
16:14:34 <gundalow> I'm currently working on getting code coverage details from Network tests, once that's finished I'll be working on the new intro_networking page
16:14:35 <itdependsnetwork> +1
16:14:37 <st8less> +1.  It will obviously be a "living" document.
16:14:41 <jmcgill298> +1
16:14:48 <gundalow> Cool, thanks
16:15:01 <gundalow> Yup, once it's live we can tweak it in place
16:15:04 <gundalow> (PRs welcome :)
16:15:05 <gundalow> )
16:15:36 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:16:02 <gundalow> So looking at the agenda (unless I've missed something) the remaining PRs have some review comments that need addressing
16:16:17 <itdependsnetwork> the facts vs get's
16:16:30 <gundalow> #topic facts vs gets
16:16:33 <itdependsnetwork> anything come of that?
16:17:35 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: Not yet, I was running the London Meetup, so wasn't at the Core meeting yesterday
16:17:49 <itdependsnetwork> ok
16:18:14 <itdependsnetwork> DI is dead, long live DI?
16:18:49 <st8less> s/^DI/SDN/
16:19:29 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:21:03 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:21:09 <itdependsnetwork> I guess it is worth mentioning to look at the 2.5 road map
16:21:38 <ogenstad> Has anything more been said about the "unable to open shell" issue?
16:21:53 <ogenstad> Got cc:ed by ansibot for another issue related to that one.
16:21:56 <itdependsnetwork> I believe PR was put in
16:22:14 <gundalow> Just finding the PR
16:22:38 <ogenstad> Another thing I was thinking about is if there's any kind of reference for the networking facts.
16:22:44 <gundalow> #topic connection: network_cli (unable to open shell)
16:23:02 <ogenstad> Any naming convension or such so that it's consistent throughout Ansible?
16:23:13 <gundalow> #info https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/32521 rewrites the connection framework.
16:23:20 <gundalow> #info NO MORE UNABLE TO OPEN SHELL!!!!!!!!!
16:23:21 <itdependsnetwork> what does: Implement a feature that handles platform differences and feature unavailability.
16:23:24 <itdependsnetwork> mean?
16:23:54 <gundalow> #info this allows `connection: network_cli` (as well as backwards compatabilty for `connection: local`
16:24:30 <gundalow> The real error message will be displayed by ansible-playbook, rather than "unable to open shell"
16:25:38 <Qalthos> pending some action plugin changes if you've copied the 'fail if not connection=local' check
16:25:40 <gundalow> Once it's merged we will mention it here, really needs lots of testing, and we are looking to the community (you lovely people) to help with that
16:27:27 <evgenyf> Hi guys, I have a couple of pool requests for new modules awaiting reviews, can you please have a look ?
16:27:48 <ogenstad> That sounds great.
16:27:48 <gundalow> evgenyf: sure, once we are back on OpenFloor (which platform are they for?)
16:27:57 <evgenyf> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31243 #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31776
16:27:59 <gundalow> Any other questions on the connection work?
16:28:51 <ogenstad> Currently we wait until you have merged it and test?
16:29:02 <Qalthos> I really hope to have it in this week
16:29:09 <gundalow> ogenstad: yup, just got a few issues to sort out first
16:29:34 <evgenyf> guandalow: sorry, what is OpenFloor?
16:29:42 <ogenstad> Would perhaps be nice to at least open issues for the action plugins which doesn't get changed.
16:30:18 <gundalow> evgenyf: sorry, I meant once we've finished this topic we can move to discuss your PRs
16:30:33 <evgenyf> guandalow: ok, sure
16:31:05 <ogenstad> Is there any target date for 2.5? I.e. when does the testing need to be done

16:32:45 <gundalow> Targetting 2.5.0 for March 2018
16:33:57 <skg-net> Is there any plugin development guide, Iâ€™m trying to create a plugin (CPS api) for openswitch instead of the previous module_utils approach
16:34:43 <gundalow> skg-net: No guide that I'm aware of, may be best to discuss that in #ansible-devel after this meeting. That channel should have the right set of people in
16:35:01 <gundalow> Any other question on 2.5?
16:35:18 <skg-net> Thanks
16:35:55 <gundalow> #topic Radware ADC devices

16:36:26 <EricDost> Sorry, quickly back to 2.5 - not sure if that's the right topic but any word on updating the git module to support commits, etc?
16:36:34 <gundalow> #info vdirect_commit: committing pending configuration on Radware ADC devices https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/31776
16:37:05 <gundalow> EricDost: erm, not sure, though that's not Network related. Could I redirect you to #ansible-devel for that one. Thanks
16:37:10 <gundalow> evgenyf: Hi
16:37:24 <gundalow> Do we have anyon Radware vDirect users here?
16:37:37 <evgenyf> gundalow: hi
16:37:50 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: Any of the NTC community use Radware vDirect?
16:38:10 <gundalow> Would be good to get some users to test and review
16:38:28 <evgenyf> The first module was merged in v2.4, those are another two
16:38:35 <gundalow> evgenyf: Have any of your customers used these new modules yet?
16:39:30 <evgenyf> gundalow: not yet, we do those modules because customers want to use them)
16:39:56 <gundalow> evgenyf: Sounds good
16:40:15 <evgenyf> gundalow: those were tested only by myself
16:40:29 <gundalow> Cool, just trying to get a feel of how much they've been tested
16:41:03 <evgenyf> They were tested by myself on real systems and they have unit testing
16:41:55 <gundalow> evgenyf: Thanks. I've merged both of them
16:42:08 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:42:12 <gundalow> Anyone got anythign else?

16:42:55 <itdependsnetwork> had a customer, and I used it then
16:42:59 <evgenyf> gundalow: oh! so quick
16:43:09 <gundalow> evgenyf: I'd looked through them before
16:43:43 <evgenyf> itdependsnetwork: I think you was using the old module which did not make it to be merged right?
16:43:54 <itdependsnetwork> correct
16:44:39 <evgenyf> itdependsnetwork: well, you can use new modules if you still have the customer
16:44:47 <itdependsnetwork> I will let them know
16:44:59 <evgenyf> itdependsnetwork: nice!
16:45:51 <evgenyf> itdependsnetwork: it will be great to test it on real
