16:03:38 * rcarrillocruz away home, but reading channel periodically
16:04:19 <trishnag> o/
16:04:22 <rcarrillocruz> been working on adding more images support to image builder role. Now supports building latest vyos, eos, nxos and vqfx

16:05:15 <funzo_> #info eng team updates
16:06:00 <funzo_> qalthos is out today due to power outage, but here is his update: "it looks like a unified API connection is the way to go, stay tuned for an updated proposal covering API plugin details"
16:06:33 <trishnag> Have been reading network-engine code, getting used to parsers for engine, worked on some bugfixes there. Now getting the tests ready for network-engine. Will have the test PR ready probably by end of the week.
16:06:50 <privateip> hi
16:07:16 <rcarrillocruz> https://github.com/rcarrillocruz/build-networking-image , will likely move that over to ansible-network org at some point

16:08:31 <funzo_> ok, moving on then to the agenda
16:08:49 <funzo_> #info A proposal for eAPI connection type
16:08:58 <funzo_> #link https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/102
16:09:43 <funzo_> Qalthos: just in time, I posted the eAPI connection type proposal just before you connected
16:10:15 <Qalthos> yeah I'm on my phone with a new client and basically useless right now
16:10:25 <funzo_> has anyone been able to go through the proposal?
16:10:39 <privateip> looks like it hasn't been updated yet?
16:10:41 <Qalthos> but I remembered my SASL password so there's that at least
16:11:28 <privateip> i think its great we can create a unified api here but im nervous that we dont know what it looks like yet and have a very short release cycle
16:12:28 <funzo_> i'm not sure what the scoping looks like on this
16:12:39 <funzo_> what's the shirt size on it
16:13:03 <Qalthos> yeah, if I had power, there would definitely be a more detailed spec out
16:13:27 <privateip> are you thinking a fully abstracted http transport as the connection plugin?
16:13:34 <privateip> with some messaging plugin on top of it?
16:18:02 <funzo_> not sure how constant his connection from his phone is
16:18:11 <privateip> ah
16:18:24 <Qalthos> I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that, but it seems sufficient to have a request builder method, a response interpreter method, and a URL builder
16:18:48 <Qalthos> I'm here, just heavily hamstrung by phone keyboard
16:18:52 <privateip> so there was a discussion in the proposal about supporting other platforms
16:19:31 <privateip> aci, f5, citrix, etc (i dont remember them all)
16:19:41 <privateip> aci for instance is REST based
16:19:54 <privateip> eapi/nxapi is JSONRPC based
16:20:18 <privateip> not sure if unified api means all of those (since they all share http as a common transport)
16:21:02 <privateip> or if unified api means JSONRPC over HTTP/S meaning we are not considering those other use cases
16:21:23 <Qalthos> that is the goal, and I didn't see anything to make that unreasonable when.i looked through ACI
16:22:16 <Qalthos> the payload building from nxapi to eapi is different enough that I'm not assuming anything about jsonrpc
16:22:54 <privateip> does that imply that the messaging is coming from the connection consumer then?
16:23:07 <privateip> ie from some code living in module_utils for instance?
16:23:35 <Qalthos> what do you mean by messaging?
16:24:18 <privateip> so the connection plugin, i'm assuming, handles lower level http verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTION, etc) along with TCP session handling
16:24:37 <privateip> but that doesn't describe what a GET message looks like
16:24:46 <privateip> or a PUT message, or a POST, etc
16:24:52 <privateip> something has to define those messages
16:24:58 <privateip> and they will be very device specific
16:26:13 <Qalthos> right, I suppose that could be handled by module_utils (sort of as it is today)
16:26:20 <Qalthos> but instead
16:26:56 <privateip> so basically you are taking module_utils/urls.py and proposing turning that into a connection plugin
16:30:27 <Qalthos> the message construction would be handled in a plugin to handle the API specific details in a sort of similar fashion to terminal plugins
16:31:04 <privateip> ah ok so there is an additional plugin involved then
16:31:32 <privateip> that makes much more sense to me
16:31:34 <Qalthos> yeah, sorry if that was unclear above
16:31:45 <privateip> no worries
16:32:06 <privateip> dag you around?
16:32:34 <privateip> im guessing not but wanted to have him weigh in on this as well
16:33:00 <funzo_> any need to update the spec with further commentary to reduce any future confusion?
16:33:22 <privateip> yeah the spec needs to rewritten almost entirely
16:33:34 <privateip> this is a signifcant change
16:33:40 <privateip> imho
16:35:16 <funzo_> #action qalthos to update eAPI spec
16:35:20 <privateip> which goes back to my earlier worry about timing
16:35:36 <funzo_> worth scoping at least?
16:35:41 <privateip> it will be tough to gauge until the spec is available for review
16:35:46 <privateip> yeah
16:36:16 <funzo_> ack
16:36:30 <Qalthos> i think it needs significant updates, but I think the core of it is still correct, it is just delegating certain tasks to a new plugin which should be fairly simple in size
16:37:02 <Qalthos> I think o should have something later today if I get power back soon
16:37:27 <privateip> cool
16:37:41 <funzo_> any further commentary before we move on?
16:37:46 <Qalthos> will keep the channel updated
16:37:51 <privateip> im good
16:37:53 <funzo_> great
16:38:02 <funzo_> let's plan on reviewing it next week again, then?
16:38:09 <privateip> yep
16:38:23 <funzo_> that's all that was on the agenda
16:38:28 <funzo_> #info open floor
16:38:34 <privateip> hopefully all interested will be able to do some real time iteration over the course of the week in the proposal as well
