16:03:52 <justjais> project board for Ansible 2.8 : https://github.com/ansible/ansible/projects/30
16:06:43 <mikewiebe> Quick question.  What is the timeline for 2.7.2?

16:12:28 <mikewiebe> justjais: Thanks!
16:12:30 <justjais> so around November 15th
16:29:15 <lindsayhill_> If there's no other business, a request from me: can someone please review https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/47533 ? CI is now OK
16:32:45 <justjais> lindsayhill_: sure I'll look in to the PR, shall take a day or two to review
16:33:01 <lindsayhill_> Thanks. Not urgent, since it's 2.8
16:34:09 <justjais> lindsayhill_: Thanx for the update.. have assigned myself for the job
16:34:28 <lindsayhill_> Much appreciated
16:46:24 <pffs> I saw that one of the issues I submitted last week looks to be fixed in devel so yay
16:47:05 <justjais> yay!
16:47:57 <justjais> so, did you get the chance to check the scenario you were facing in devel>
16:48:07 <justjais> *?
16:48:16 <pffs> haven't yet, I'll probably try later this week
16:49:00 <justjais> pffs: sure, please update the issue with your observation when you are done
16:49:14 <pffs> will do
16:49:25 <justjais> pffs: thanks
16:50:47 <pffs> not sure if anyone had a chance to glance at the others, hash support for ios_user and bastion slowness
16:52:23 <justjais> pffs: you are talking about: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/47577 right?
16:52:50 <pffs> 47593 and that one, yeah
16:53:57 <justjais> pffs: ok, so both the bugs are assigned currently
16:54:32 <justjais> 47593: Qalthos and 47577: nilashishc
16:54:34 <pffs> yeah, saw that
16:55:38 <justjais> since Qalthos is on PTO this week and 47577 was assigned today to nilashishc
16:55:44 <pffs> if they have any other questions on them, I'm usually idle somewhere in here
16:55:57 <justjais> so you can expect to hear from them max by next week
16:56:09 <pffs> yeah, no rush.
16:56:16 <justjais> sure, I shall update
16:56:32 <pffs> bastion's always been abysmally slow, I've just mostly gotten used to it :)
16:56:55 <justjais> :)
16:59:44 <justjais> Alright, thanks everyone for joining the meeting
