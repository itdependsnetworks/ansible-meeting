16:04:35 <pabelanger> #topic Core Updates
16:05:19 <pabelanger> The ansible-network team did releases this week of roles
16:05:46 <pabelanger> we've published them on https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible-network/
16:06:22 <pabelanger> right now, we don't have much information around user notification when we actually do a release, so we've started discussing how to automate that more
16:06:43 <pabelanger> this includes either sending out a mailing post, something on twitter or even both
16:07:21 <pabelanger> this is helps with automating our release processes too
16:07:47 <pffs> is there anything with examples on how to use them?
16:09:05 <pabelanger> great question, some of our roles do have documentation around usages, for example network-engine
16:09:22 <pabelanger> but right now, that is stored just in the git repo for each role
16:10:02 <pabelanger> I actually have a work item on myside to make it easier for users to view our docs of the ansible-network roles, but need to first sync with the ansible-doc team to discuss some items
16:10:11 <pabelanger> like, sytle guide and publish location
16:10:24 <pffs> yeah that'd be handy.
16:10:39 <pffs> Are these intended to ultimately replace the more specific platform modules?
16:10:44 <pabelanger> but for the most part, I think patches are welcome to improve our example, and shared that information between our current roles
16:11:26 <pffs> trying to figure out why I'd use the cisco_ios get_facts over the ios_facts module
16:13:34 <Qalthos> pffs: That is the general idea. The biggest benefit is faster release cycle for out-of-release bugfixes
16:14:09 <pffs> makes sense.
16:14:28 <pabelanger> Right, the ansible-network roles we look to release every 2 weeks, ansible/ansible currently has a longer cycle
16:15:19 <pabelanger> as always, our agenda is online
16:15:21 <pabelanger> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/labels/network
16:15:40 <pabelanger> but this week, is is actually pretty thin
16:15:56 <pabelanger> I can see a request to look at the following issue
16:16:15 <pabelanger> #topic unable to set terminal parameters on ios devices
16:16:29 <pabelanger> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46185
16:17:07 <pabelanger> I believe justjais is looking at this now, according to github
16:18:39 <Qalthos> wrt salman1485's comment (as he is the one who put this in the agenda), the terminal commands are generally necessary in order to get the complete output from the device
16:19:00 <pffs> yeah prevent wrapping and paginating
16:19:17 <Qalthos> Otherwise, the device tends to assume you have a terminal and tries to page output, which is bad
16:20:06 <pabelanger> it sounds like maybe a change in functionality between ansible versions? I get the impression this might have been working before
16:20:19 <Qalthos> The commands only affect the running session (hence why we have to send them on every connect) and make no changes to the device at all
16:20:59 <pffs> yeah pretty common. rancid does the same thing
16:21:13 <pffs> I put them into netmiko scripts I write as well
16:21:24 <skregas> concerning the terminal parameters, there was no problem in Ansible 2.4. Only start seeing errors with Ansible 2.6.
16:21:39 <Qalthos> Most of the platforms we support have something similar, if not identical
16:21:42 <pffs> I don't think it always did the term width, though, I vaguely recall having issues with long lines in older versions
16:22:11 <pabelanger> skregas: yah, that is what I see in the comments. So, possible something changed on ansible side, but I'd have to look at the commit history.
16:22:25 <Qalthos> The width was a later addition, but I don't recall when
16:23:38 <pabelanger> okay, I've added a comment to the PR, I'll see if I can look into code and see if anything changed
16:23:38 <pffs> skregas: are you getting a tacacs command authorization failure?
16:25:44 <pabelanger> #topic Open discussion
16:26:01 <pabelanger> We actually don't have anything else on the agenda, so open floor
16:26:42 <Qalthos> For reference, `terminal width 512` was added in ansible 2.4, so not sure what the change might be
16:27:27 <skregas> @pffs: on the terminal, i get, "Command authentication failure"
16:27:27 <Qalthos> (and was backported to 2.3)
16:27:48 <pffs> any chance of full network_cli support for bastion at some point?
16:28:17 <pffs> bastion is still 10-20 times slower than local and unfortunately a requirement for most of my plays
16:28:46 <pffs> skregas: sounds like it, I think the actual authorization failure messages is customizable in ACS
16:29:03 <Qalthos> pffs: Maybe eventually? We haven't forgotten about you, and I think about it several times a week, and I will make sure you are the first to know if there is any progress
16:29:50 <pffs> sounds good
16:30:27 <pffs> we had some internal discussions about replacing rancid with ansible but with current speeds wouldn't be possible
16:31:08 <pabelanger> I should also mention, if you are planning on contributing code to https://github.com/ansible-network, I've enabled a dco license check job for all our PRs. So, you'll need to use the 'Signed-off-by' header in commit messages.
16:32:30 <pabelanger> I'll give it a few more minutes, then we'll close out today if nothing else
16:33:05 <Qalthos> pffs: Do you have an issue open about that? I don'
16:33:14 <skregas> @pffs: here's my confusion. In 2.4, with a read-only account, there were no issues with the terminal length/width commands. In 2.6 there is, and nothing about that read-only account has changed. That leads me to believe something in Ansible is different?
16:33:17 <Qalthos> t recall if there was one or not
16:33:59 <pffs> Qalthos: for the network_cli improvement?
16:34:07 <Qalthos> pffs: yeah
16:34:46 <pffs> not that I recall, it was something along the lines of "we'll look at it but it'll take a lot of work so might take a while"
16:35:37 <pffs> skregas: it's possible you were using a 2.4 release prior to when it was added in? Qalthos said 2.4 but not sure if that means 2.4.0 or not
16:35:54 <Qalthos> pffs: You can still make a feature request issue, and at least there we can collect all the conversations about it and share any progress
16:36:18 <pffs> will do
16:36:20 <Qalthos> pffs: skregas: It was in rc1, so that seems unlikely
16:36:58 <pffs> it's possible that maybe the error handling for that command failure changed as well
16:37:19 <pffs> so perhaps it just silently ignored the command failing previously?
16:37:36 <pffs> There are some error messages that still have that behavior
16:38:35 <pffs> Qalthos: I had some questions on ios_user I'd posted in here previously, not sure if they quite count as enhancements or bugs or a bit of both
16:38:56 <Qalthos> #topic ios_user queries
16:39:30 <pffs> right now if you try to set a new password on a user who is configured using password instead of secret ansible ignores the failure message about not being able to set a secret and password at the same time and marks it as changed despite not actually doing anything
16:40:46 <pffs> it would also be massively useful to be able to able to specify a specific hash for users since we do password rotation on a quarterly interval and right now there's not an idempotent way of tracking what changed so I end up using ios_command instead
16:42:28 <Qalthos> The first does seem like a bug
16:43:06 <pffs> ios_config, rather, not ios_command
16:43:48 <pffs> yeah, to figure out which users needed to be redone I basically just ran the ios_config version several times and the ones that still said changed I reran to remove and readd the user since that was the only way I could easily tell that it was the wrong type
16:45:11 <Qalthos> Feel free to open an issue on that and we'll see what we can figure out
16:45:38 <pffs> Do you want me to open a single issue for both items, or one for the first half as a bug and one for the second half as a feature enhancement?
16:46:01 <Qalthos> two issues, please
16:46:27 <pabelanger> +1
16:48:10 <pabelanger> pffs: Qalthos: anything else or should we close out?
16:48:18 <Qalthos> We (being the ansible networking team) are unlikely to implement that feature in the module itself, as that work is more likely to be directed to a user configuration role
16:48:39 <pffs> will do
16:48:43 <pffs> Nothing else on my side
16:48:47 <Qalthos> (see: most of the things we've talked about for the last n months)
16:50:08 <Qalthos> But that doesn't mean someone else can't do it
16:50:28 <Qalthos> #topic Notices
16:51:01 <Qalthos> #info Python 2.6 support has been removed from the ansible controller as of Ansible 2.7
16:51:27 <pabelanger> yes, thank you for that
16:51:39 <pabelanger> I had that in my notes locally
16:53:00 <Qalthos> network modules run on the controller, so that means you need Python 2.7 or 3.5+ to work
16:53:24 <Qalthos> I think that's everything
16:56:24 <pabelanger> Yah, I want to discuss more about our actually testing on different python versions, but that can be another time / date
16:56:51 <pabelanger> with that, i think we can finish off for now. Thanks everybody for attending
