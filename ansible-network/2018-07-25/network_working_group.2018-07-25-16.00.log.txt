16:07:10 <Qalthos> #chair Anil_
16:07:10 <zodbot> Current chairs: Anil_ Qalthos ganeshrn gundalow privateip rcarrillocruz trishnag
16:07:28 <Qalthos> Haha, I was too quick for you
16:07:41 <Qalthos> #topic Lenovo port to persistence pt. 2
16:07:54 <Qalthos> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/43194
16:08:02 <Qalthos> (remembered to link it this time)
16:08:16 <Qalthos> Anil_: I assume this is what you were referring to?
16:08:19 <Anil_> some one please review
16:08:48 <Anil_> This is in similiar lines that you have reviewed previously
16:08:54 <Anil_> 42500
16:09:15 <Qalthos> It looks good, I had one question about why you have comments in your EXAMPLES, but other than that, it looks good
16:10:06 <Anil_> That examples didnot worked when I ran end to end test using real switch. Because that configuration doesnot apply to L2 port
16:10:14 <Qalthos> I mentioned before you joined that my plan was to merge it after we're done here
16:11:33 <Anil_> I thought, it always better to present what all i could finish by wednesday as PR. As if like its a scrum iteration of 1 week
16:11:52 <Qalthos> But you aren't running directly from the EXAMPLES in the module right? I mean they're just examples
16:12:18 <Anil_> true. But I have a set up in my lab which run these examples
16:12:42 <Anil_> and I cannot cheat customer, so I verify them all by running
16:13:18 <Qalthos> If the module doesn't support whatever it is, I would remove it untril it does, and if it does support it, I don't see why you would need to comment anything
16:13:38 <Anil_> sure. I will remove the commented examples
16:14:00 <Anil_> u add it as a review comment
16:14:10 <Qalthos> I did indeed
16:14:25 <Anil_> oh thanks for that
16:14:51 <Qalthos> Anil_: Anything else you want to bring up?
16:15:20 <Anil_> Nothing, so thankful to you for reviewing my code
16:15:27 <Qalthos> Anil_: Sure
16:15:36 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:16:03 <Anil_> And Ganesh has been trying on introducing timeout configuration for each command, what happend to that ?
16:16:34 <Qalthos> That is merged, let me look up the PR
16:17:12 <Anil_> I think I may need it when i started working on image upload , config upload , back up etc
16:17:38 <Qalthos> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42847 should tell you all about how to use per-task timeouts
16:18:03 <Qalthos> #action somebody make sure that is documented
16:18:32 <Anil_> Thanks
16:19:12 <Qalthos> acozine: I will probably follow up on that, try to help me not drop that
16:20:03 <Qalthos> (or whomever, I just picked on you because I can see you're in here)
16:20:23 <Qalthos> Anything form anyone else?
16:40:11 <Qalthos> Right, thanks everyone for coming by
