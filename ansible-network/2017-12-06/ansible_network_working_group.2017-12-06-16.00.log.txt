16:10:19 <gundalow> Hi everyone!
16:10:47 <gundalow> #info Agenda as always https://github.com/ansible/community/labels/network
16:11:50 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:11:57 <gundalow> Anyone got anything for today?
16:13:28 <dt-arista> just a quick question regarding the upcoming network-cli connection changes
16:13:32 <gundalow> Sure
16:13:39 <dt-arista> and its very possible this is answered in the documentation and i have missed it
16:13:49 <dt-arista> so i apologize for my lack of reading skillz in advance :)
16:14:01 <gundalow> nps, we can always improve the docs
16:14:28 <dt-arista> if you want to connect to a network mode using a non-cli method (lets say eapi for the sake of discussion) will this connection be local + provider cict?
16:14:50 <Qalthos> For the time being, yes
16:14:54 <gundalow> IN 2.5 yes
16:15:15 <gundalow> in 2.6 it will be connection: network_<something> (maybe network_http)
16:15:26 <Anil> any samples are in github which I can refer as a sample ?
16:15:27 <gundalow> name needs bikesheading
16:15:52 <dt-arista> ok
16:16:05 <gundalow> Anil: For new platforms (which should only support network_cli) there are examples linked from https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/group-network/network_dev_network_cli.rst
16:16:06 <dt-arista> one follow up
16:16:22 <Anil> Sure i will refer that
16:16:52 <gundalow> For examples on how to support provider & network_cli (for platforms that already existed in Ansible 2.4) see the existing Core Network modules (e.g. vyos)
16:16:56 <gundalow> dt-arista: sure
16:17:02 <gundalow> #chair skg-net
16:17:02 <zodbot> Current chairs: Anil Qalthos dt-arista gundalow jmcgill298 kedarX skg-net
16:17:11 <dt-arista> if you specifiy the provider dict in 2.5 but the connection == network_cli the provider dict is just ignored for modules that support network_cli?
16:17:28 <Qalthos> dt-arista: yes
16:17:36 <dt-arista> cool, thanks again
16:17:56 <gundalow> You need to extend the code to print a warning
16:18:53 <gundalow> #info warn on network_cli + provider: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/33355
16:19:20 <dt-arista> got it
16:19:35 <gundalow> dt-arista: Which platform is this for?
16:19:51 <dt-arista> eos/arista stuff
16:20:02 <gundalow> We've done eos
16:20:22 <dt-arista> ok, thought so, it was mainly for end users writing playbooks against it
16:20:23 <gundalow> You thinking CloudVision?
16:20:27 <dt-arista> and what the expected behavior is
16:20:29 <dt-arista> and yes
16:20:36 <dt-arista> for cloudVision too
16:21:14 <dt-arista> what i am hoping to do is to get this new connection method in our automated test suite sooner than later so we can get ahead of any problems that our customers might hit
16:21:22 <dt-arista> since thats been a bit problemmatic for us in the past
16:21:40 <dt-arista> do you think the code in devel is at that stage? or is there a RC for 2.5?
16:21:47 <gundalow> so Cloud vision is HTTP(s) so that will need to wait for the connection: network_http work in 2.6. Once that framework is in we will create some docs along the lines of https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/group-network/network_dev_network_cli.rst for that
16:22:09 <dt-arista> cool
16:22:20 <gundalow> I don't think there will be any changes to cv_server_provision_module in 2.5
16:22:30 <gundalow> (from a connection point of view)
16:22:38 <dt-arista> is it expected that we are on the hook for the transport:eapi or is that something you guys would be taking on
16:22:46 <dt-arista> cool, that does clear that up
16:23:12 <dt-arista> obviously nothing for 2.5
16:23:25 <dt-arista> but when network_http comes out
16:24:01 <gundalow> dt-arista: I *think* we (Ansible Core Team) will end up creating `connection: network_http` and we will update eos and nxos to use that and deprecate the provider/transport: eapi/nxapi
16:24:19 <dt-arista> cool thanks
16:24:27 <gundalow> #chair samerd
16:24:27 <zodbot> Current chairs: Anil Qalthos dt-arista gundalow jmcgill298 kedarX samerd skg-net
16:24:33 <dt-arista> i understand that is still under discussion
16:24:45 <dt-arista> just trying to get an idea of whats coming down the line a bit
16:24:51 <gundalow> Sure, totally understand
16:25:23 <gundalow> Did you get an invite to the Network Partners call later this month, we will go though it in that
16:25:30 <dt-arista> yep
16:25:32 <dt-arista> i will be there
16:26:04 <gundalow> cool
16:26:16 <gundalow> samerd: Hi :)
16:26:22 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:26:24 <dt-arista> thats all i had
16:26:28 <dt-arista> thanks for the responses
16:26:39 <gundalow> no problem, good questions :)
16:27:13 <samerd> gundalow: Hi, sorry for being late
16:27:26 <gundalow> samerd: It's all good :)
16:27:33 <gundalow> How you getting on?
16:28:28 <samerd> great, I will push mlnxos_interface soon and will add some infra code
16:28:41 <gundalow> ace
16:28:52 <gundalow> good stuff on getting the network_cli port done
16:29:16 <gundalow> as mentioned before, feel free to raise all the PRs at once for the remaining modules (one module per PR)
16:29:17 <samerd> Thanks for the approval
16:29:28 <gundalow> Anil Qalthos dt-arista gundalow jmcgill298 kedarX samerd skg-net Anyone got anything else?
16:29:55 <samerd> I'll do that after the next PR that will contain some infra to avoid conflicts
16:30:04 <gundalow> Sounds good
16:30:05 <skg-net> nothing much from our side..the porting to the network_cli is going on for dellos* modules
16:30:50 <gundalow> skg-net: Just to clarify, that's supporting provider & network_cli
16:33:34 <skg-net> I just got that..we will support both..we were actually removing the provider support
16:35:20 <gundalow> skg-net: well you can't remove provider for anything that existed in Ansible 2.4 as that's been released, you will need to give users time to update their playbooks to use `connection: network_cli`
16:35:37 <gundalow> in Ansible 2.9 is when we will remove `provider:`
16:36:59 <skg-net> got it..
16:37:22 <gundalow> skg-net: Do you think you will support network_cli for 2.5?
16:37:34 <gundalow> e.g. code merged by Jan 15th?
16:37:41 <skg-net> yes for sure..
16:37:45 <gundalow> Cool
16:37:53 <skg-net> currently its with our testing team to validate the changes
16:38:04 <gundalow> That's great
16:38:16 <skg-net> we need to include the provider back..
16:38:28 <skg-net> along with the warning..
16:41:05 <ganeshrn> gundalow: we have not yet added deprecation warning for provider to be removed in 2.9
16:41:17 <gundalow> ganeshrn: ah, OK
16:41:19 <ganeshrn> deprecation warning is for to level args
16:41:24 <gundalow> ah, yes
16:41:28 <gundalow> sorry, was getting confused
16:41:49 <ganeshrn> iirc we decide to add deprecation warning for provider in 2.6
16:42:30 <gundalow> skg-net: We should get Dell into DCI (Distributed CI)
16:43:05 <skg-net> sure..let me know what is needed from our end.. I sent you a Dell OS10 VM yesterday..
16:43:29 <skg-net> I will send a Dell OS9 VM as well.
16:43:48 <gundalow> #topic Distributed CI (DCI)
16:43:57 <gundalow> Will give the steps here so others can beneffit
16:45:16 <gundalow> #info Docs on DCI https://github.com/ansible/dci-partner-ansible
16:45:35 <gundalow> Basically you run a dci-agent on RHEL7/CentOS 7 machine inside your lab
16:45:52 <gundalow> and define an inventory which lists which machines you can test against
16:46:06 <gundalow> I'll be doing a demo in the partner call
16:47:08 <skg-net> okay.. I will get that started..send me a document or any info you have..
16:48:04 <skg-net> oops missed the above link..Thanks..will go over those..
16:48:07 <gundalow> :)
16:48:23 <gundalow> I'll create accounts for you and send you an email with details in
16:49:47 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:50:20 <gundalow> Thank you for your time everbody
