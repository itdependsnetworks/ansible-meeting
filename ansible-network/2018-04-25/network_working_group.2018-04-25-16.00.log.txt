16:03:43 <gundalow> So looking at the agenda I don't see anything
16:04:10 <gundalow> the HTTP connection proposal (https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/103) was agreed last meeting

16:05:08 <gundalow> #topic Potential performance issue in 2.5.*
16:05:13 <brampling> I just added some PRs I need reviewed
16:05:51 <gundalow> brampling: Thanks, can do that next
16:05:59 <gundalow> #info https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/38892
16:07:17 <gundalow> #info We've been investigating a possible performance issue when running with many hundreds of network devices. Current investigation shows that during 2.5 development we've accidently introduced a global lock
16:07:36 <gundalow> #info the linked issue has more details. We are working on a fix
16:08:04 <gundalow> #info depending on when the fix is confirmed we will review if that means that 2.5.2 should be made earlier
16:08:15 <gundalow> #info this issue only effects 2.5.*
16:08:47 <trishnag> o/
16:09:06 <ganeshrn> nitinkr: good to see you here

16:15:08 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pulls/brampling
16:15:37 <gundalow> brampling: I notice they have the `stale_ci` label, which means it's been over 7 days since CI (Shippable) run, so I've triggered a fresh run
16:15:49 <brampling> Ok
16:16:08 <brampling> We have a big joint customer looking for this functionality
16:16:40 <gundalow> brampling: FYI provisional dates for Ansible 2.6 https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_6.rst
16:16:53 <gundalow> #info Ansible 2.6 provisional dates https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docs/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_6.rst
16:17:09 <brampling> Thanks, sooner than I'd expected
16:17:22 <gundalow> Yup, we are keeping 2.6 as a smaller release
16:17:57 <brampling> They need one or two more things, I'll try to get them in by mid-May
16:18:05 <brampling> I'm happy to point them to devel
16:18:27 <samerd> gundalow: thanks for posting the 2.6 roadmap, just wanted to ask about it
16:18:38 <gundalow> samerd: :)
16:20:18 <gundalow> brampling: Could you please raise a PR to add yourself to https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml#L436 that way you will be notified on any issues/PRs for NIOS. Also your PRs will get label:owner_pr, which means we trust you are doing the right thing
16:20:47 <gundalow> Also if their is anyone else in your team that you think it would be worth getting notified, feel free to add them
16:21:34 <brampling> Ok, will do
16:21:52 <gundalow> Thanks
16:23:11 <gundalow> brampling: I've assigned them to justjais who will do a quick review and merge

16:25:35 <gundalow> brampling: Do your modules return anything?
16:26:19 <brampling> No, just make changes to Infoblox
16:26:21 <gundalow> brampling: ie https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37676/files#diff-30e479e3f6b8c57e15a4edde857c4ee3R164 does that return anything via `register:`
16:26:26 <gundalow> cool, thanks
16:26:33 <brampling> They're based on the nios_host_record module
16:26:40 <brampling> That @privateip wrote
16:28:14 <gundalow> brampling: cool. Actually I'll add you to BOTMETA and add a way so all your issues and PRs get labels, will make it easier for your to manage. Will ping you details via a PR (so you will get GitHub email)
16:28:22 <brampling> Ok, thanks

16:48:05 <gundalow> brampling: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39310
16:48:10 <pffs> gundalow: looks a lot like the issue I opened
16:48:24 <pffs> although I also notice a pretty huge different in performance even on small scopes
