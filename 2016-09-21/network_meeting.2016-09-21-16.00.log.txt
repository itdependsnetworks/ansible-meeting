16:00:57 <gundalow> hi caphrim007 and Qalthos
16:01:01 <caphrim007> heyo
16:01:01 <gundalow> #chair Qalthos
16:01:01 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos gundalow
16:02:17 <gundalow> Does anyone have anything to discuss today?
16:02:18 <mhite> Ayo
16:02:42 <caphrim007> gundalow: there was an f5 pr that came through recently
16:02:47 <caphrim007> but it was a feature req
16:03:06 <caphrim007> is 2.2 branched yet so that we can merge that?
16:03:11 <gundalow> not branched
16:03:16 <gundalow> not branched yet
16:03:26 <gundalow> Is the change to a module, or module_utils?
16:03:31 <caphrim007> module
16:04:17 <gundalow> Since it's isolated I'm happy to entertain the thought of it going into 2.2.
16:05:37 <gundalow> caphrim007: Have you added tests for the feature and are happy with the PR?
16:05:50 <caphrim007> not yet
16:06:00 <caphrim007> i just saw the email this morning
16:07:14 <gundalow> ACK
16:07:24 <caphrim007> so i'm impartial on whether it goes in to 2.2
16:07:47 <gundalow> We generally have 3-4 months between releases
16:08:01 <caphrim007> mhite: thoughts?
16:08:31 <mhite> Change looks pretty straightforward at a glance, so I see no issue
16:08:50 <caphrim007> then i'm +1
16:09:07 <gundalow> got a link, I can't see it in https://ansible.sivel.net/pr/byfile.html
16:09:26 <caphrim007> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2988#issuecomment-248571667
16:09:29 <gundalow> oh is it https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2988
16:09:36 <caphrim007> aye
16:10:24 <gundalow> Well if you both give it shipits then I'm happy to merge
16:10:35 <caphrim007> k
16:10:44 <caphrim007> i'll add tests in the meantime
16:12:24 <gundalow> a) merge then add tests
16:12:29 <gundalow> b) add tests then merge
16:13:25 <caphrim007> if something is broken then i'll consider it a bug and fix it in between the RC's
16:13:30 <caphrim007> but i dont think it will break
16:13:32 <gundalow> sounds good
16:13:33 * gundalow merges
16:14:39 <gundalow> merged
16:14:44 <caphrim007> thx
16:14:49 <gundalow> no problem
16:14:54 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:15:20 <phil-dileo> I have something
16:15:26 <gundalow> phil-dileo: sure :)
16:15:50 <phil-dileo> Iâ€™ve been working with some enterprise customers that need some more flexibility around â€”check mode.
16:16:30 <gundalow> #topic --check
16:17:09 <phil-dileo> Basically, they canâ€™t run in â€”check mode because network config is based on external API calls that donâ€™t get executed in check mode.  So, theyâ€™d like to be able to run in standard mode and execute the *_config or *_template module to see what commands would be run against the switch without actually sending them
16:19:13 <gundalow> caphrim007: Do your modules run correctly in --check mode?
16:19:41 <gundalow> I haven't look into that part of the code, or some much runs in --check mode, though I believe most modules are idempotent
16:19:43 <caphrim007> they should, but i cannot verify as i have not added tests for that
16:20:18 <gundalow> phil-dileo: the _template modules may not be idempotent. Use the _config modules instead
16:20:35 <gundalow> phil-dileo: Do you know which modules your customers are having issues with
16:21:19 <phil-dileo> I understand *_config is the module of choice going forward, but the concept applies to both _template and _config.
16:22:13 <gundalow> I *believe* if you use _config and the version of the software running on the Network Device supports diff then you *should* be able to run correctly in --check mode
16:22:27 <gundalow> privateip would know more, however he's not here today
16:22:42 <phil-dileo> Itâ€™s not a bug, we might need to add an enhancement; a new argument that letâ€™s the module gather the current running config, generate the new config from the jinja template and then log which commands would be run
16:23:08 <phil-dileo> Ah, I didnâ€™t realize he isnâ€™t here.  I did run this past him.  Wanted to see if anyone else saw this as valuable
16:23:32 <gundalow> He normally is here, just not today
16:24:45 <phil-dileo> No worries, Iâ€™ll follow up with him
16:25:16 <gundalow> I think one way foward would be to raise an issue at https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues and then add it to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110 so we can discuss it next week
16:25:28 <phil-dileo> Will do
16:25:31 <gundalow> Thanks :)
16:25:31 <phil-dileo> Thanks
16:25:37 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:26:18 <gundalow> work continues on testing networking for 2.2, We are feature complete as shown on https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/docsite/rst/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_2.rst (search for "networking")
16:26:25 <gundalow> lots of testing an bug fixing remains
16:27:05 <phil-dileo> Did you need a hand still on the test cases for banner login and banner motd?
16:28:00 <gundalow> phil-dileo: oh that would be great if you have some spare time. It's on my list, though after adding in the tests for all the new modules/functionality added in 2.2
16:28:34 <phil-dileo> K, Iâ€™ll take a look. I still havenâ€™t played much with the testing infra in that repo.
16:30:06 <gundalow> All you need to do is drop a testcase in roles/test_eos_config/tests/cli/ then run with ansible-playbook all.yaml -e "limit_to=eos_config"
16:30:29 <gundalow> (just using eos as an example)
16:30:57 <gundalow> oh, and put something like
16:31:03 <gundalow> [eos]
16:31:14 <gundalow> eos01
16:31:24 <gundalow> ^^^ in your inventory file
16:31:52 <gundalow> feel free to message me directly on IRC, or add comments onto the existing issue you created if you need anything
16:32:18 <gundalow> FYI I'm in the UK, so you may not get a response straight away :)
16:33:18 <phil-dileo> Great! thanks!
16:33:21 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:33:52 <gundalow> phil-dileo: You are most welcome, thanks for the offer of help
16:36:04 <gundalow> Cool
16:36:11 <gundalow> thanks for your time everybody
16:36:33 <gundalow> As always add your thoughts and ideas to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
