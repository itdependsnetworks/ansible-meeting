19:01:51 <jtanner> Omw
19:02:06 <ryansb> hi folks
19:02:11 <abadger1999> Óla
19:02:17 <gundalow> #topic custodianship of the AWS modules
19:02:24 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/148#issuecomment-276347992
19:02:27 <gundalow> willthames: over to you
19:02:41 <willthames> thanks
19:02:57 <willthames> so the rate of acceptance of AWS module PRs in particular has been pretty bad recently
19:02:57 <alikins> bloop
19:03:10 <willthames> e.g. 1.5 months to change Falsentry to False
19:03:41 <willthames> I've imported several PRs from the old repos that are months old with no review etc
19:04:07 <willthames> something is going wrong, I'm not 100% sure on how best to fix it, but more people with shipit rights, more committers, etc would be a start
19:04:27 <willthames> interested to hear ryansb's thoughts too
19:04:34 <bcoca> just some context, i believe aws is group with most people with 'shipit' rights
19:04:45 <bcoca> and other modules have been languashing for longer
19:04:55 <willthames> do you have *any* evidence for that first assertion bcoca?
19:04:59 <bcoca> ^ not saying it justifies, but this is endemic
19:05:23 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/blob/master/FILEMAP.json
19:05:33 <willthames> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.txt
19:05:36 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.txt
19:05:43 * jtanner just sat down
19:05:58 <jtanner> which aws module(s) ?
19:06:07 <willthames> right, so lots of people with ship it rights on a *single* module
19:06:10 <gundalow> jtanner: https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/148#issuecomment-276347992
19:06:23 <bcoca> willthames: the fallback is 'grouping'
19:06:29 <willthames> no one with shipit rights on cloud/amazon as a whole
19:06:33 <willthames> I don't have shipit rights
19:06:35 <willthames> so who dows
19:06:37 <willthames> does
19:06:57 <ryansb> willthames: yeah, we do have lots of AWS PRs waiting, and I've been reviewing & merging, but expanding the pool of people that can review & test would help
19:07:24 <willthames> another problem is zero call to review on PRs
19:07:36 <bcoca> willthames: they do have as a whole
19:07:45 <willthames> who do?
19:07:49 <bcoca> those in aws
19:07:53 <willthames> who is in aws?
19:08:16 * bcoca feels he is in laurel and hardy skit now
19:08:51 <ryansb> zero call to review? I think everyone's aware that someone needs to review PRs
19:09:00 <jtanner> ec2.py is 'supported_by': 'committer', ... so it can be labeled shipit, but it will never be automerge
19:09:30 <jtanner> and in terms of "call to review", @name in github doesn't draw people in
19:09:39 <jtanner> some people pay attention, most don't
19:09:55 <jtanner> the bot is pinging anyone explicitly listed as a maintainer though
19:09:59 <willthames> sorry, not what I meant ryansb, actually you're right, there is a call to review but jtanner's point is valid
19:10:10 <willthames> a lot of reviewers may no longer be at all active
19:10:11 <ryansb> Yeah, but we can't make community members review PRs if they don't want to
19:10:18 <ryansb> also that
19:10:34 <jtanner> and for modules with 1 maintainer, the bot is now allowing people who maintain a module in the same namespace to give a 2nd shipit ... they are also being pinged
19:10:37 <willthames> no, but if community members aren't even aware there is stuff in need of review...
19:10:51 <willthames> jtanner is that a new thing?
19:10:54 <jtanner> show me a ticket that didn't ping people
19:10:58 <ryansb> yes, pretty recent
19:10:58 <bcoca> willthames: comminity_review label?
19:11:06 <jtanner> the namespace change is a few days old
19:11:18 <ryansb> namespace pinging was within the last week or so
19:11:21 <allanice001> Hey, sorry I'm late
19:11:24 <bcoca> ^ actually thought that is how it worked all alaong
19:11:26 <willthames> bcoca, was thinking more active notifications, perhaps like ansible/aws was designed for
19:11:36 <jtanner> define "active"
19:11:39 <ryansb> what about that would be more active?
19:11:44 <willthames> I get an email
19:11:49 <bcoca> willthames: people already complain about spam
19:11:55 <jtanner> i can't email people through github
19:12:04 <willthames> you can do @willthames and I get an email
19:12:09 <bcoca> ^ cc @person normally triggers email
19:12:10 <jtanner> that is already done
19:12:18 <bcoca> but not always, depends on user's settings (default is email)
19:12:22 <willthames> sure
19:12:28 <jtanner> if you aren't a maintainer, but want to be ping'ed, you can be added to the FILEMAP.json
19:12:43 <bcoca> ^ we need to make that process clearer
19:12:46 <willthames> I would like to be pinged on all AWS changes
19:12:50 <willthames> PRs that is
19:13:01 <willthames> I would like overall shipit rights on AWS changes
19:13:09 <jtanner> ok, file a bug in ansible/ansibot and i will make it happen
19:13:16 <jtanner> but notification != shipit rights
19:13:27 <jtanner> you need to be added to MAINTAINERS.txt for that
19:13:29 <willthames> Ideally I would like commit rights too
19:13:39 <bcoca> jtanner: we need to move the data file to ansible/ansible and have docs point people at it for 'community maintenance process'
19:13:41 <willthames> not really a new request...
19:13:49 <gundalow> I've emailed GitHub to ask them so we can request GitHub PRs reviews from people outside of those with commit rights, got their standard "Thanks for the suggestion" email
19:14:05 <bcoca> gundalow: great, we'll have in 4yrs
19:14:11 <jtanner> github doesn't care about repos with >10 people
19:14:24 <jtanner> not their target market
19:14:25 <willthames> perhaps we need more AWS modules at community status
19:14:28 <gundalow> bcoca: aye, well they added the ability to see what reviews are assigned to you
19:14:30 <ryansb> community shipits still weigh in when I'm reviewing. Like, if I see a PR (as a committer) and the maintainer hasn't commented but there's community shipits that's a factor
19:14:34 <willthames> clear down maintainers.txt to active reviewers
19:15:03 <bcoca> willthames: we have process for that, if maintainer has not responded for a while to any tickets
19:15:20 <jtanner> we do?
19:15:31 <willthames> when was that last checked?
19:15:33 <bcoca> jtanner: i must have had that conversation with myself
19:15:48 <bcoca> jtanner: thought you had that done already ....nvmd then
19:15:48 <jtanner> i'd like there to be one, but i didn't write anything to make it so
19:16:01 <gundalow> jtanner: bcoca we have an agenda item for today regarding taking over modules, so we can talk about that after this
19:16:52 <willthames> how is that even tracked?
19:16:55 <bcoca> gundalow: i belivve that is subset to what issues willthames brought up, some i thought we had solved a while ago ...
19:17:22 <gundalow> bcoca: you, I didn't want us to get sidetracked on taking over orphaned modules
19:17:25 <jtanner> willthames: it's not currently ... not by anything under the redhat umbrella
19:18:30 <jtanner> the problem with the cloud modules is the number of people who even have the ability to test them
19:18:37 <jtanner> i don't have accounts
19:18:41 <willthames> jtanner, sure
19:18:44 <willthames> I have lots now
19:18:56 <jtanner> which is why i don't feel the core team should be gating them
19:19:00 <willthames> I have been inactive in AWS space for about two years, until the last month
19:19:24 <willthames> and now I'm very active again, I see the lack of support on AWS modules
19:19:38 <jtanner> you were the support ...
19:19:41 <willthames> some of that will be legacy, some of that will be active maintainers leaving the project
19:19:50 <ryansb> jtanner: I have the necessary accts, just not the necessary hours
19:19:54 <willthames> jtanner and now I have 15 open AWS PRs and not much getting them through
19:20:05 <resmo> hi
19:20:08 <bcoca> so a) we need DOCUMENTED phasing in/out of maintainers
19:20:08 <willthames> most of them aren't even mine, I'm just shepherding old PRs through
19:20:13 <willthames> morning resmo
19:20:38 <jtanner> the cloud modules aren't suffering any problems that all the other modules are not
19:20:59 <willthames> bcoca, can we see how long tickets have been in waiting_for_maintainer or whatever
19:21:18 <willthames> if several tickets have been waiting on same maintainer, they get dropped
19:21:25 <willthames> not after a week, but after a month
19:21:27 <willthames> say
19:21:44 <jtanner> and who replaces them? @ansible ?
19:21:47 <jtanner> that won't work
19:22:13 <bcoca> i would not replace in a month, its rare, but some people do take 1 month vacation (less rare outside USA)
19:22:21 <willthames> who can do it? ryansb can, I can
19:22:31 <willthames> bcoca, I did say 'say'
19:22:37 <bcoca> willthames: dont commit ryansb .. he has plenty on his plate
19:22:50 <jtanner> you'll do it this month while it's your hot ticket item, but when you job responsibilities shift again, you'll be off to different things
19:23:11 <willthames> well, what's your alternative jtanner? as it appears to be no-one can do it
19:23:20 <willthames> whereas i'm willing to do it
19:23:31 <bcoca> lets see if this is better: 1) allow new maintainer sto be added at any time , 2) after 2months of non response, maintainer gets listed for deprecation 3) after review/contact process ? he gets removed
19:23:32 <willthames> and maybe in six months the project will have the same problem
19:23:42 <willthames> he/she bcoca
19:23:46 <bcoca> jtanner: there is no way around the 'shifhting'
19:23:56 <bcoca> we just need to make maintainers 'phasing in' easier
19:24:13 <jtanner> most of the modules under cloud/aws have only 1 maintainer, so you already have shipit capability because you maintain something in there
19:24:23 <jtanner> cloud/amazon/ec2_snapshot.py: willthames
19:24:27 <willthames> that's not true, unless that's changed in the last week
19:24:40 <willthames> I added shipit to a PR and it got removed :(
19:24:45 <jtanner> which?
19:25:00 <willthames> two secs
19:25:05 * mattclay will be away for a few minutes
19:25:14 <bcoca> willthames: many reason sfor removal, anyone can add 'shipit' comment but it will only count if you are maintainer
19:25:19 <jtanner> there's also bugs in the bot sometimes, and i try to fix those if pointed out
19:25:34 <willthames> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/18842
19:25:54 <willthames> so you two are making completely different arguments
19:26:35 <bcoca> added automerge
19:26:43 <bcoca> ^ athat is why shipit was removed
19:26:58 <jtanner> no, that should have stayed
19:27:02 <jtanner> i'll figure it out
19:27:04 <bcoca> jtanner: bug then?
19:27:05 <willthames> sorry, 'added automerge' makes no sense as a sentence
19:27:17 <bcoca> ￼ ansibot added automerge community_review
19:27:21 <jtanner> automerge is under review right now until we are sure the algo is correct
19:27:23 <bcoca> ^ labels
19:27:31 <jtanner> so for now, it's just a label and not an action
19:27:48 <bcoca> willthames: so it was working for you, bug made it go away when we were attempting to have bot set automerge
19:27:51 <ryansb> So automerge (the tag) is going to mean the bot will merge PRs that have the shipit label after the sufficient community/maintainer/committer shipits
19:27:59 <ryansb> which is not yet implemented
19:28:07 <willthames> so community_review is supposed to be sufficient for shipit?
19:28:44 <jtanner> no
19:28:46 <bcoca> jtanner: we need to setup workflow diagrams
19:28:56 <jtanner> community_review is a state, meaning it's waiting on people to give shipits
19:29:02 <willthames> ok, if it was a bug, or a not yet implemented feature, that's fine, but that PR was embarrassing
19:29:03 <bcoca> probably after we stop redefining workflows ....
19:29:31 <willthames> if I had commit rights it would have long been sorted...
19:29:44 <jtanner> no, you'd be squirreled off into some other niche area
19:30:16 <willthames> I meant that specific PR jtanner
19:30:36 <willthames> I'm not expecting to resolve all issues with AWS PRs, I'm not a naive idiot
19:30:51 <bcoca> willthames: you are on the short list, but we have not set date to review current permissions, w/o bugs the 'shipit' shoudl havee been enough
19:31:11 <willthames> ok
19:31:32 <willthames> I'm relatively happy with your course of action bcoca
19:31:33 <bcoca> ^ i think bot will help more than commit privs as it gives a good balance between commit permissions and scope of them, github is all or nothing
19:31:57 <willthames> bcoca, still understood from a year ago, still occasionally frustrating from a year ago
19:32:07 <bcoca> willthames: we are constantly trying to improve, lots of stuff going on, i though some of this was already done, sorry i was wrong
19:32:08 <willthames> but that's why I turned up here, to find out what was going on
19:32:10 <resmo> .oO(willthames has not commit rights??!)
19:32:22 <willthames> resmo, no, still...
19:32:24 <bcoca> willthames: i just closed PRs over 2yrs old ...
19:32:32 <resmo> o_O
19:33:10 <bcoca> i had to x2 check, thought we gave him last time we revised perms
19:33:15 <gundalow> (30 minutes)
19:33:43 <jtanner> "what was going on" ... summary: too many PRs and too many issues, no matter how big the core team gets. The way we're dealing with it is to give more capabilities through the bot, since github doesn't care.
19:33:43 <bcoca> willthames: going forward, let us know when you see this stuff, issues/pr against ansibot help
19:33:51 <willthames> yep, will do
19:34:15 <allanice001> I think adding a mention in core's agenda also works
19:34:30 <willthames> too many inactive maintainers as well jtanner
19:34:31 <allanice001> That way, someone can keep it on the radar
19:34:39 <bcoca> its also why we have these meetings ... we are always happy to merge low hanging fruit (i probably glossed over that once they resolved the merge conflict, i should have merged then)
19:35:00 <willthames> means a PR languishes for months before people realise that no maintainer is looking at it
19:35:03 <jtanner> inactive maintainers is not a manpower problem, imo. It's a problem with us allowing too many modules into the code.
19:35:23 <willthames> jtanner, really?
19:35:27 <bcoca> jtanner: i agree, but we are fighting windmills until ansible-installer
19:35:45 <bcoca> willthames: we are close to 900+ moduels .. i would have less than 60
19:35:58 <willthames> wow, ok, batteries included no longer a thing eh?
19:36:03 <jtanner> if we keep at this pace, we are going to have a python abstraction for every concept in world of computing. We can't possibly maintain all of that.
19:36:05 <bcoca> ansible-aws-plugins should be it's own project
19:36:10 <bcoca> imo
19:36:22 <allanice001> Make that ansible-cloud-plugins
19:36:30 <willthames> plugins or modules?
19:36:37 <allanice001> Because you have open stack (close to aws)
19:36:40 <allanice001> azure
19:36:40 <bcoca> allanice001: that is virtual package that includes ansible-azure-plugins, anisible-vmware....
19:36:59 <allanice001> i see
19:37:13 <bcoca> willthames: plugins, i want to be able to also have lookup('aws_meta') ...
19:37:30 <willthames> we should probably move on - where should I raise a 'cull inactive maintainers' issue?
19:37:32 <bcoca> willthames: and THAT package can depend on boto
19:37:35 <bcoca> boto3
19:37:40 <jtanner> i don't think "batteries" was ever meant to be "everything everyone ever wanted"
19:37:49 <bcoca> willthames: that is next item on agenda, gundalow has on ticket
19:37:54 <willthames> ok
19:38:26 <bcoca> gundalow: i believe i outlined a process above, though for that user (that does not exist on github anymore) i think we are passed 3)
19:38:47 <bcoca> the question is, who should own by default?
19:38:59 <gundalow> #topic Orphaned mode process (uri)
19:39:05 <bcoca> ^ my vote for 'community' modules is leave orphan and have those in same category assume mantle
19:39:13 <gundalow> It says 'supported_by': 'core'
19:39:15 <bcoca> jtanner: will that work with bot?
19:39:19 <bcoca> gundalow: then its core
19:39:26 <jtanner> huh?
19:39:38 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/pull/291
19:39:40 <gundalow> jtanner: https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/pull/291
19:39:47 <bcoca> module_utils/uri .. not module
19:39:53 <bcoca> and yes, that was always 'core supported'
19:39:59 <bcoca> feel free to remove name
19:40:27 <gundalow> The agenda item is about network/basics/uri.py
19:40:35 <jtanner> it should be @ansible
19:40:35 <gundalow> which currently points to romeotheriault
19:40:55 <bcoca> ah, that uri.py ..
19:40:59 <gundalow> not sure why module_utils was mentioned
19:41:19 <bcoca> modue_utils/uri.py .. which has most of the code uri.py and other modules that do http requests use
19:41:23 <bcoca> sorry, i conflated
19:41:26 <gundalow> nps
19:41:43 <gundalow> So are people happy with https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/pull/291
19:41:45 <bcoca> still, core module, its our 'generic http/restapi requests' module
19:41:46 <gundalow> if so I'll merge
19:41:59 <bcoca> happy ..NO... resigned
19:42:06 <willthames> gundalow I am, but still need a way to find other inactive maintainers
19:42:30 <willthames> this one is only obvious because they appear to have left github
19:42:39 <bcoca> which is easy case
19:42:40 <gundalow> willthames: If you see PRs that aren't getting pinged with everyone under cloud/amazon/ then let us know
19:43:12 * allanice001 can assist with reviews / testing of was PR's willthames
19:43:20 <gundalow> allanice001: Thank would be ace, thanks :)
19:43:28 <allanice001> S/was/aws
19:43:45 <willthames> gundalow obvious example: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20214
19:43:57 <willthames> thanks allanice001
19:44:21 <willthames> gundalow that's probably one out of many
19:44:39 * mattclay is back
19:44:41 <willthames> note that the original commits are over a year old now
19:45:00 <gundalow> hum, so ec2_vpc_nat_gateway_facts isn't in MAINTAINERS.txt
19:45:13 <allanice001> Close to 60 open containing AWS
19:45:14 <gundalow> jtanner: I would have expected the bot to ping everyone
19:45:28 <jtanner> why?
19:45:34 <gundalow> to ask for a review
19:45:47 <jtanner> on a PR without a maintainer?
19:45:50 <willthames> gundalow it's a new module
19:45:57 <gundalow> oh
19:45:57 <willthames> how do new modules get reviewed?
19:46:00 * gundalow reads the actual PR
19:46:07 <gundalow> jtanner: sorry, ignore me
19:46:10 <bcoca> +1 to adding willthames to cloud/aws maintainers
19:46:13 <willthames> shouldn't the bot ping everyone?
19:46:21 <jtanner> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/blob/master/ISSUE_HELP.md#new-modules
19:46:22 <bcoca> willthames: not everyone ...
19:46:35 <willthames> bcoca, *anyone* ?
19:46:41 <bcoca> someone
19:46:46 <jtanner> "community" is defined as maintainers in the same namespace in that regard
19:46:51 <bcoca> someone on the list in the path for maintainership
19:47:02 <willthames> but if noone knows about it
19:47:27 <willthames> It's not even clear to me from that PR that that's what I should do
19:47:28 <bcoca> we need to document 'community_review' and probably have a 'needs maintainers'
19:47:38 <bcoca> ^ then link those in docs as queries for peopel wanting to participate
19:48:10 <jtanner> i -think- the bot should have pinged a bunch of people on 20214
19:48:13 <jtanner> checking
19:49:16 <willthames> jtanner could it be a side effect of repomove?
19:49:34 <allanice001> Add @maintainer tags in doctstring perhaps?
19:49:58 <willthames> it seems to have the right labels, but not the right comments from the bot
19:50:08 <jtanner> hrm, the bot wants to ping a bunch of people on it now
19:50:13 <willthames> allanice001 problem is that goes out of date
19:50:14 <jtanner> because of the namespace change
19:50:29 <allanice001> An example cou
19:50:32 <willthames> jtanner, I have a whole list of similar PRs
19:50:34 <allanice001> Could be """
19:50:49 <allanice001> @maintainer: allanice001 2017
19:51:03 <allanice001> @maintainer: willthames 2017
19:51:05 <allanice001> etc
19:51:12 <jtanner> willthames: there's a skip logic to avoid re-processing issues that haven't been updated since last run
19:51:16 <jtanner> that's probably what happened here
19:51:29 <jtanner> bot_status command or any comment could trigger it to check again
19:51:54 <jtanner> the skip logic is one of the tactics i have to use to avoid rate limiting
19:52:23 <willthames> jtanner, ok, I'll do that at a human pace over the next couple of days then :)
19:53:06 <willthames> not for 20214 though as bcoca merged it - thanks!
19:53:15 <bcoca> was easy to review
19:53:27 <bcoca> sometimes you just need to ping right person at right time
19:53:42 <jtanner> 18842's problem was that the submitter made a commit -after- the maintainer did shipit
19:53:56 <jtanner> then during a bot code test, shipit was added and removed
19:54:15 <bcoca> ^ which is how it should be
19:54:30 <jtanner> it was going to be re-added after you and the maintainer had redone his shipit ... but someone merged it beforce then
19:54:36 <bcoca> but probably bot should say that (new commit detected, shipit count reset)
19:55:14 <jtanner> that will kill the ratelimit
19:55:37 <bcoca> :-(
19:55:39 <gundalow> right, I need to go and sort stuff out for Paris.
19:55:48 <gundalow> Can someone take over chairing please?
19:55:49 <jtanner> bot_status will give counts as needed
19:56:11 <allanice001> enjoy gundalow
19:56:25 <willthames> jtanner, that's not right
19:56:36 <jtanner> what isn't?
19:56:48 <willthames> my shipit got removed after a comment
19:57:05 <jtanner> your shipit was the 1st one after the last commit
19:57:16 <willthames> and the bot added shipit label
19:57:21 <willthames> and then later removed it
19:57:26 <jtanner> yes, during a code revision
19:57:27 <willthames> after a comment, not a commit
19:57:37 <jtanner> i fixed a logic bug, it re-calculated, and removed the shipit
19:57:53 <jtanner> ... then the maintainer added another shipit
19:57:59 <jtanner> bringing the count to 2
19:58:47 <willthames> right, I guess the lag between commit and shipit label being removed didn't help
19:59:06 <jtanner> the reset logic was being implemented that day
19:59:22 <willthames> I would suggest shipit1 and shipit2, but guess that's yet another rate limiting limited feature ;)
20:00:27 <jtanner> it is
20:00:37 <jtanner> object creation is severely rate limited
20:03:02 * jtanner does a full run on all PRs without the skip feature to get things re-synced
20:03:37 <jtanner> will probably take >2 hours
20:04:22 <abadger1999> Okay, are we done on this topic?
20:06:23 <willthames> abadger1999 I think so - bcoca, I'll raise a PR for MAINTAINERS.txt
20:06:44 <willthames> not sure that I understand FILEMAP.json sufficiently to make any changes or understand if one is needed
20:07:24 <jtanner> if you are going add "cloud/aws: willthames" to MAINTAINERS, you don't need to change FILEMAP
20:07:52 <willthames> ok
20:08:24 <willthames> bcoca, do you need an issue to track inactive maintainers?
20:08:48 <willthames> sorry abadger1999 I'm kind of done, just checking on actions
20:09:06 <abadger1999> #topic PR 20737 bugfix for test-module
20:09:28 <abadger1999> allanice001, willthames: Looks like you two are working on this right now.
20:09:37 <allanice001> yup
20:09:48 <willthames> yep, just need to check final result
20:09:52 <allanice001> Final patch should be up, if willthames agrees
20:10:09 <willthames> will test on my OS X laptop as brew makes for a great test case
20:10:24 <allanice001> Which is how I found the bug ...
20:10:31 <willthames> saying that a virtualenv works fine too
20:10:43 <willthames> yeah, I hadn't tested the non ansiballz case
20:10:48 <willthames> not even sure how I would tbh
20:12:04 <allanice001> I'm working through gundalow's refactored module building docs
20:12:18 <allanice001> And just happen to not be in a virtualenv
20:12:23 <abadger1999> probably a ruby module from the ansible-for-rubyists repo would test nonansiballz
20:12:34 <abadger1999> windows module might.
20:13:01 <abadger1999> not entirely sure about that, though as I've not tested powershell stuff out
20:13:15 <allanice001> BDS perhaps
20:13:16 <abadger1999> Cool.
20:13:17 <allanice001> ?
20:13:35 * bcoca looks for old perl module
20:14:02 <abadger1999> Okay, allanice001and willthames: Let me know when you're happy with it and I'll merge.
20:14:09 <willthames> allanice001 is timetest.py just print json.dumps(datetime.now()) ?
20:14:19 <willthames> I guess that would be non ansiballz
20:14:25 <willthames> abadger1999 will do
20:14:27 <allanice001> yeah
20:14:38 <willthames> can you put that in the PR for replication purposes?
20:14:43 <allanice001> Literally from the docs
20:14:45 <allanice001> ack
20:14:55 <allanice001> Would a comment suffice?
20:14:58 <willthames> sure
20:15:17 <willthames> we can take this off #ansible-meeting, sorry
20:15:36 <allanice001> np
20:16:12 <abadger1999> Cool.
20:16:21 <allanice001> added
20:17:04 <abadger1999> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20058  systemd-nspawn connection
20:18:14 <bcoca> +1 , but wanted more eyes on it
20:18:50 <bcoca> disclaimer: this is in no way a waiver on my right to critisize systemd in general
20:19:18 <agaffney> heh
20:20:31 <abadger1999> No problem with it in general, there's some code that needs changing as general style, python2.6 compat and such.
20:20:42 <bcoca> abadger1999: go2town
20:20:55 <abadger1999> bcoca: if you're fine with the overall, I'll just review the specifics and we can merge when they fix them.
20:21:00 <abadger1999> Cool.
20:21:41 <abadger1999> #action systemd-nspawn connection plugin, abadger1999 will look at some specific code quality and then we can merge
20:22:08 <abadger1999> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/18379 lookup plugin for system keyrings
20:22:17 <abadger1999> bcoca: yours again
20:22:24 <bcoca> same deal
20:22:44 <bcoca> i'll add docs if merged
20:24:00 <bcoca> also, not sure what we want for passing args to looups anymore
20:25:54 <abadger1999> bcoca: Looks okay to me.
20:26:24 <abadger1999> actually.. minor nitpick.. you can change it when you do docs:
20:26:54 <abadger1999> modify the error message to specify it's the python keyring module.
20:27:04 <abadger1999> we have too many uses of the term module otherwise.
20:27:08 <bcoca> he
20:27:15 <abadger1999> #topic Open floor
20:27:16 <bcoca> python keyring LIBRARY
20:27:18 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20567
20:27:21 <abadger1999> bcoca: <nod>
20:28:36 <willthames> abadger1999 https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20737 is good now
20:29:30 <jtanner> willthames: it missing a shippable status
20:29:37 <jtanner> close and re-open it
20:29:52 <jtanner> allanice001: ^
20:30:01 <allanice001> enroute
20:30:07 <willthames> jtanner pretty sure we don't have reopen rights
20:30:19 <jtanner> the owner doesn't?
20:30:26 <jtanner> he just did it
20:30:27 <abadger1999> bcoca: Looks like a nice feature.... I'm wondering if there's a noticable performance cost to it, though.
20:30:33 <willthames> oh, clearly he does
20:30:38 <jtanner> allanice001: that did it, thanks
20:30:51 <willthames> I'm sure I've made that mistake in the past and had to ask for a ticket to be reopened
20:30:57 <willthames> legacy info at best I guess
20:31:33 <allanice001> I think I can, cause I'm a contributor for that PR
20:31:58 <jtanner> submitter
20:32:16 <bcoca> abadger1999: not that i've found, should only happen 1 per invokation
20:32:28 <allanice001> Submitter, yes
20:32:59 <allanice001> But I'm not a maintainer on something like https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20214, so I can't do same there (as an example)
20:33:46 <abadger1999> <nod>  And it's not recursive either so won't hurt people who define inventory vars.
20:34:38 <abadger1999> bcoca: Okay, looks fine to me.
20:38:43 <abadger1999> Anyone else have something for today?
20:38:55 <abadger1999> If not, I'll close in 60s
20:39:26 <podlesh> can I suggest https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19707 ?
20:39:59 <podlesh> looks like I should have been online last two tuesdays... which I haven't (my mistake)
20:41:00 <bcoca> -1
20:41:19 <abadger1999> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19707 Serial group_by
20:42:51 <podlesh> the main question is: is there any way to make similar feature in apropriate way, at this moment
20:43:10 <podlesh> or should I just close the PR and use patched version of ansible?
20:46:14 <podlesh> ... or maybe some other time - I just don't want to contibute to already quite huge number of open pullrequests
20:46:49 <abadger1999> bcoca: So I'm not sure if podlesh's example is solvable with current serial.
20:47:23 <abadger1999> bcoca: example is here: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19707#issuecomment-271683995
20:48:30 <jtanner> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19707#issuecomment-271683995 looks more like a "zip" than a "groupby" to me
20:48:51 <jtanner> example #1
20:49:41 <podlesh> good point, zip is more pythonic term...
20:49:48 <allanice001> i'm concerned with dynamic inventory possibly breaking - that could become a bigger issue, especially as this is core module
20:51:14 <jtanner> i don't see the correlation with 19707 and dynamic inv
20:51:27 <allanice001> In his example
20:52:00 <allanice001> <q>correct result ([A1,B1,C1],[A2,B2],[A3]) can be achieved by serial: [3,2,1]
20:52:00 <allanice001> unfortunately, obtaining these values is not easy, especially for dynamic inventory (unless they are known beforehand - but in that case the whole feature is suprfluous)</q>
20:55:04 <jtanner> i don't see how it affects dyn inv
20:55:15 <jtanner> the feature is ignored if the keyword is absent
20:56:46 <allanice001> But with keyword supplied, dyn inv would need to be parsed before it gets here
20:58:19 <jtanner> podlesh: did you test dyn inv?
20:58:25 <jtanner> or did you see a test in there
20:58:58 <jtanner> dyn inventory is parsed on load, afaik
20:59:49 <podlesh> I think I've tested it with dynamic inventory, but I can test it again for sure
21:00:21 <podlesh> but I can argue that if dynamic inventory would not be parsed at this point,  even normal serial:  feature would not work either
21:01:40 <jtanner> pretty sure you are correct
21:01:45 <jtanner> worth testing though
21:03:16 <abadger1999> okay, seems that bcoca is busy with something else and jimi-c is en route to paris today/this week.
21:03:26 <abadger1999> podlesh: are you able to attend next week?
21:03:54 <podlesh> yes
21:04:56 <abadger1999> cool.  then I think, test dyn inv ( but I'm pretty sure it will work), we'll try and talk more about this next meeting when bcoca and jimi can both be here.
21:05:08 <podlesh> ok, thanks
21:05:19 <abadger1999> And with that, I think we should let the channel go so the next meeting can take over
21:05:24 <abadger1999> #endmeeting
