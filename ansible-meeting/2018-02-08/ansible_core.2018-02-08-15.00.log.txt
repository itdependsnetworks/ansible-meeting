15:11:44 <thaumos> I was curious about that as well.
15:12:39 <ryansb> hey folks
15:13:14 <sivel> I wasn't at last thursday, and it wasn't discussed tuesday
15:13:17 <bcoca> i thought the whole reason to hae this early was for apac people to be able to attend
15:13:31 <sivel> yeah, and all those people who complained, aren;t attending anyway
15:13:37 <bcoca> ha
15:14:11 <bcoca> we do get them on thursdays but only when they added soemthing to agenda, since they cannot erally attend on tuesdays
15:14:40 <bcoca> we just seem to have had a drop on agenda items as of late
15:18:08 <gundalow> yup
15:18:31 <gundalow> Not even got enough people here to go through proposals, which is somnethign we said we'd do every so often
15:20:12 <bcoca> i think we should keep the time, just close it early if nothing to do
15:20:24 <bcoca> which we did this tuesday also
15:20:33 <bcoca> so i dont think its a question of scheduled time
15:21:13 <bcoca> i think its more that people either dont think the process works, dont know about it or if they do, dont have anything pressing to discuss
15:23:43 <thaumos> alright well that being said, let's close early.  There isn't much to discuss.
15:23:55 <thaumos> we have the release to work on anyhow.
15:23:59 <gundalow> thaumos: +1
15:24:07 <thaumos> ending meeting, thanks everyone!
