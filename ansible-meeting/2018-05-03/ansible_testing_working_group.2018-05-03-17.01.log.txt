17:03:55 <mattclay> The only new item on the agenda is a comment (https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/248#issuecomment-386002297) from robinro, to which I've already responded. I believe he also mentioned in #ansible-devel that he would not be here for the meeting to discuss.

17:06:52 <gundalow> Nothing from me
17:06:58 <Pilou> Could not each target be executed in a new environment ? from time to time
17:07:29 <mattclay> Pilou: That would be quite expensive, and slow.
17:09:08 <mattclay> For containers, mostly slow. For VMs, especially ones we pay for by the hour, very expensive. But even the ones paid by the minutes/second we'd still pay for a lot of startup/shutdown overhead which would usually far exceed the test run time for each test.
17:11:29 <mattclay> Fortunately this is a fairly rare problem, but it does occur from time to time.
17:11:52 <mattclay> A similar one is when a test fails if another test runs before it.
17:12:40 <mattclay> There are only so many combinations of things we can test.
17:14:13 <mattclay> We used to have this same problem with unit tests, before we started running each one isolated. Unfortunately that does cause the unit tests to run much slower.
17:17:36 <mattclay> Pilou: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
17:18:59 <mattclay> Pilou: Oh, and thanks for cleaning up more of the import errors. We're down to just 6 left.
17:27:28 <mattclay> If nobody has anything else, I'll end the meeting in a few minutes.
