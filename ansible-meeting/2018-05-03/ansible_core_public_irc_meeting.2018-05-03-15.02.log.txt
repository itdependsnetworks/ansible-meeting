15:02:35 * bcoca waves
15:02:51 <sac> I had a couple of PRs to discuss. I'll ping them here for convenience.
15:03:09 <bcoca> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37822
15:03:11 <sac> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37771
15:03:33 <sac> That was reviewed by Pilou...
15:03:56 <sac> I think I have addressed the comments.
15:04:23 <sac> Would like to request some reviews.
15:04:35 <bcoca> did you check with other gluster maintainers?
15:05:09 <bcoca> i've never used it, last i tested it was over ~= 10yrs ago

15:05:55 <sac> bcoca, I will check with gluster maintainers.
15:06:09 <bcoca> iirc rosmo was one  .. unsure of others
15:06:13 <sac> Last time I checked they lacked any Ansible or Python expertise.
15:06:33 <bcoca> i mean 'ansible gluster module maintainers'
15:06:37 <bcoca> not gluster guys themselves
15:06:44 <sac> Yeah.
15:06:54 * sdoran waves
15:06:57 <sac> I will do that.
15:07:03 <sac> Thanks.
15:08:16 <bcoca> if you still cant find anyone ping us in #ansible-devel and we'll try go get someone to look at them
15:08:52 <bcoca> if pilou has already reviewed one, he is normally quite engaged, he is community member so its on his volunteer time
15:09:09 <sac> bcoca, yeah I understand.
15:09:21 <sac> Sure, I had pinged once in #ansible-devel, I'll talk to gluster maintainers once, before I come back again.
