17:11:52 <resmo> just a general question out of curiosity. are there any plans with zuul-ci?
17:14:01 <gundalow> resmo: Hello!
17:14:05 <gundalow> Yes!
17:14:35 <gundalow> resmo: https://github.com/ansible/zuul-test-repo/pull/4 is a fork of ansible/ansible running VyOS (Network platform) integration test
17:16:29 <resmo> interesting.
17:19:23 <gundalow> So the plan is we can run jobs via Zuul in (say) Cisco's lab and report status back on ansible/ansible PRs
17:21:20 <gundalow> resmo: We are also using Zuul for the Galaxy roles that Network Team is creating, such as https://github.com/ansible-network/network-engine
17:26:26 <gundalow> resmo: I need to head off now, feel free to ping me directly if you have other questions
17:26:33 <gundalow> Happy to go through any of it with you
17:32:59 <mattclay> Does anyone have anything else they'd like to discuss?
17:34:34 <gundalow> Nothing else from me
17:34:38 <gundalow> Thanks y'all
