19:05:57 <bcoca> agaffney:  my only issue is dataloader relying on config now .. since we use dataloader to 'load the config'
19:06:51 <jtanner> it needs integration tests.
19:07:35 <agaffney> the PR adds integration tests
19:07:53 <jtanner> i see unit but not integration
19:08:03 <agaffney> oh, sorry, yes
19:08:16 <agaffney> you're right
19:09:01 <agaffney> bcoca: I understand that concern, but it's a dependency in a different code path than is used to load the config, so it seems "safe"
19:09:27 <bcoca> still, seems like begging for circular import issue
19:09:34 <bcoca> not a blocker
19:09:58 <sivel> Overall I am "meh" on the idea of the feature. I don't have a strong opinion.
19:09:58 <agaffney> that's not even an important part of the implementation. it's mostly there to prevent code duplication
19:10:30 <bcoca> just nitpicking, that part can be outside of dataloader .. its more 'finder'
19:10:34 <agaffney> I could have greatly simplified the PR by just copying some existing code to handle vars dirs
19:10:50 <bcoca> but i do like it being in 1 place vs several
19:11:00 <agaffney> right, it's better for long term maintenance
19:13:22 <abadger1999> Not really familiar with the code but the discussion seems like the code should be split out to a new file which both current users can reference.
19:14:05 <agaffney> I personally have no great need for this feature, but it's been requested often. I have no strong feelings about the implementation or the feature itself
19:14:32 <agaffney> it's more of a code de-duplication with the side effect of a new feature :)
19:16:17 <bcoca> vote?
19:16:26 <bcoca> +1 (though i might want to move the common function later)
19:17:10 <sivel> +/-0
19:17:29 <abadger1999> +0
19:18:38 <abadger1999> So that seems like it's approved.
19:18:40 <agaffney> do I win something for the most "meh" proposed change ever? :)
19:19:13 <jtanner> you get a meh from me
19:19:28 <jtanner> meh.
19:20:25 <bcoca> ok, so that was only agenda topic
19:20:28 <bcoca> #topic open floor
19:22:04 <bcoca> if nothing else i'm closing meeting in 1min
19:23:24 <bcoca> #endmeeting
