15:05:54 * mikedlr is impressed by Gundalow's happy life.
15:06:18 * gundalow is trying to finish documentation for 2.4
15:07:03 <mikedlr> I can discuss a bit about forums for getting people interested in playing with ansible deployment of AWS lambdas and stuff like that. Any suggestions?
15:07:20 <mikedlr> sort of community outreach from the AWS working group.
15:07:32 <thaumos> have you joined the ansible-aws working group/>
15:07:36 <gundalow> #info 2.4.0RC3 is out PLEASE TEST IT
15:07:37 <mikedlr> gundalow already got one furum in london.
15:07:49 <mikedlr> thaumos: I proposed the AWS WG ;-)
15:08:06 <thaumos> ;-)
15:08:11 <thaumos> it was a shameless plug

15:08:47 <mikedlr> it is very excellent and all people with a slight interest in AWS should come and join us and test and fix modules !
15:08:53 <thaumos> ^ that!
15:09:07 <thaumos> I will see if there is a way to have us promote it on the Twitters
15:09:22 <thaumos> can you DM me with details?
15:09:34 <thaumos> and I will see what I can have happen
15:10:32 <mikedlr> sure;  I have some slides / talk but I should rework them so they are suitable for an audience that doesn't know ansible.
15:10:39 <thaumos> üëç
15:10:43 <mikedlr> e.g. explain why we use ansible.
