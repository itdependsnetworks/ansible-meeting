15:10:35 <gundalow> #info https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/23265
15:10:54 <gundalow> looks like bcoca's fix need some extra eys on it
15:11:21 <gundalow> abadger1999: looks like that's with you for the moment
15:11:47 <bcoca> gundalow: nothing changed since tuesday ... we are still trying to figure out 'correct functionality'
15:11:51 <gundalow> ack
15:12:01 <gundalow> bcoca: same for "how should paths work"?
15:12:18 * gundalow has been in 3 days of meetings, and hasn't had a chance to look though Tuesday's meeting minutes yet
15:12:19 <bcoca> idem
15:12:21 <abadger1999> <nod> I'll try to get to it for the Tuesday meeting
15:12:21 <gundalow> ack
15:12:42 <gundalow> #action abadger1999 to try and review for next meeting
15:12:59 <gundalow> #topic Plugin docs

15:13:11 <gundalow> #action gundalow to add in CI for this
15:13:22 <gundalow> #topic Versioned docs
15:13:55 <gundalow> I spoke with docschick, versioned docs work should start soon
15:14:24 <gundalow> So we need to ensure we backport docs fixes (docs/docsite/rst) as well as module docs where applicable to (at least) stable-2.3
15:15:02 <gundalow> This is needed as by default (default URL, internal searhc & google) will prefer the docs for the latest stable *over* devel
15:15:18 <gundalow> Everyone OK with that?
15:15:28 <abadger1999> +1
15:15:34 <mattclay> +1
15:16:12 <gundalow> \o/
15:16:17 <Qalthos> +1
15:16:39 <gundalow> #action COMITTERS remember to backport docs (docs/docsite/rst) as well as module docs to (at least) stable-2.3
15:16:48 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
15:16:56 <gundalow> anyone else got anything?
15:17:11 <gundalow> sivel: anything from you?
15:17:13 <bcoca> does backport include 2.4 features?
15:17:25 <bcoca> ^ shoudl clarify that only 'doc fixes'
15:17:31 <sivel> Nope, was just looking to see if I had anything, I do not seem to
15:17:33 <gundalow> Ah, good question
15:17:57 <gundalow> Docs + functionality should be in the same branch
15:18:14 <bcoca> lots of version_added: "2.4" stuff will be added to docs, dont think that stuff should be backported (cause its whole reason people want versioned docs to begin with)
15:18:25 <gundalow> bcoca: +1
15:18:42 <bcoca> though it would be funny ....
15:19:17 <abadger1999> sensible to me as well.
15:19:45 <gundalow> Just need to remember when creating/updating RST to backport them
15:20:21 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
15:22:57 <gundalow> mkay
15:23:05 <gundalow> Thank y'all
15:23:16 <gundalow> #info Please test 2.3.0 FINAL :)
