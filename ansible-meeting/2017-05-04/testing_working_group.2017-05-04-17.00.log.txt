17:00:13 <zodbot> The meeting name has been set to 'testing_working_group'
17:00:21 <mattclay> Agenda: https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/114
17:01:12 <mattclay> It looks like there's nothing on the agenda today, so I'll just give updates and then open up for discussion.
17:01:41 <mattclay> I've been working on implementing support for cloud module testing in ansible-test this week, as part of my work for the 2.4 roadmap.
17:02:10 <mattclay> The initial implementation covers AWS and CloudStack. I'm hoping to have it deployed and running on Shippable tomorrow.
17:02:46 <mattclay> With that, we'll be able to test AWS modules and CloudStack modules when PRs are opened.
17:03:14 <mattclay> The AWS support is a work in progress. As more modules have tests added, I'll need to update the IAM policy to allow the tests to run.
17:03:29 <mattclay> #topic Open Floor

17:09:02 <mattclay> I'll keep the meeting running for a while. If anyone shows up, just ping me.
