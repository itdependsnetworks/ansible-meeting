15:04:28 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
15:04:35 <gundalow> Nothing on the agenda for today
15:04:54 <allanice001> i had #action to investigate git branch alias
15:05:03 <gundalow> #topic git branch alias
15:05:31 <allanice001> i found it not worth the effert if only one or two people are going to use it
15:06:00 <gundalow> How so?
15:06:24 <allanice001> you need to setup a lot of non-standard stuff for it to work with github
15:06:38 * jimi|ansible here
15:06:52 <allanice001> as git push -u devel and git push -u master need to push to the same place
15:06:52 <mattclay> Can you elaborate a little?
15:07:23 <allanice001> github wont treat the branches as alias
15:07:24 <jimi|ansible> gundalow: this is a flat out no for me, we have devel, not master, people just need to deal with that
15:07:34 <allanice001> it treats it as two seperate branches
15:07:40 <gundalow> jimi|ansible: ACK
15:07:43 <jimi|ansible> it's been this way for 4 years, and i'm not changing it
15:07:53 <jimi|ansible> (almot 5 now actually)
15:07:55 <allanice001> my vote is #NO
15:08:04 <jimi|ansible> s/almot/almost/
15:08:05 <gundalow> Ok, so we can close that then
15:08:27 * gundalow assumes that jimi|ansible's vote counts for more than (say) mine
15:08:27 <allanice001> #agree
15:08:54 <gundalow> #info We are sticking with devel. It's been like that for 4+ years </topic>
15:09:02 <gundalow> allanice001: Thanks for investigating though :)
15:09:06 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
15:09:10 <allanice001> ack
15:09:12 <jimi|ansible> i rarely if ever make my vote count more than anyone elses :)
15:09:13 <bcoca> jimi|ansible++
15:09:21 <bcoca> that is my job!
15:09:25 <jimi|ansible> heh
15:09:42 <allanice001> documentation irc bot
15:09:50 <allanice001> #topic ^
15:10:07 <allanice001> #topic documentation irc bot
15:10:17 <bcoca> +100 to having it, i just don't see who/how its going to get done when it needs 'company resources'
15:10:53 <allanice001> i’m not in redhat company, but can contribute github.com/allanice001/rj45
15:11:20 <bcoca> making the bot is the easy part, finding a reliable home for it and managing permissions is the 'fun' part
15:11:29 <allanice001> if there is a resource i can access remotely, i don’t mind working on it
15:12:54 <allanice001> i looked at zodbot, just not familiar with supybot code, tthough it seems it can also be easily extended
15:13:21 <allanice001> would that be an option ? zodbot has an existing home
15:14:22 * gundalow -> afk for a bit
15:14:42 <bcoca> there are dozend of existing bots taht can do this by config alone, no need to develop, again the issue is setup
15:17:23 <allanice001> then it could possibly share the zodbot home?
15:18:18 <jhawkesworth> I guess company would need oversight too.  Don't want an errant checkin turning it into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)
15:18:56 <allanice001> true story
15:19:51 <jimi|ansible> or Skynet
15:20:08 * bcoca is working on it
15:21:14 <bcoca> jhawkesworth: but that was a non starter ... if you use twitter to 'learn humanity' .... I don't know how they expected otherwise ....
15:22:20 <jhawkesworth> bcoca: totally.  docbot proposal is 'usefully constrained' though
15:24:49 * allanice001 votes for at least a !slap command too
15:25:13 <allanice001> :D
15:26:38 <bcoca> im partial to !shovel
15:31:31 <jhawkesworth> I guess might need to handle more load than the meetbot?  Never run a bot so no sure what resources they need.
15:31:33 <allanice001> anything else on docbot proposal?
15:32:28 <allanice001> usually very light
15:32:30 <jhawkesworth> unless anyone knows who runs the meetbot and whether that would be viable, still sounds like it needs some company resources to check on it
15:33:39 <allanice001> jhawkesworth: afaik, meetbot is run by fedora team
15:36:52 <allanice001> fwiw, RJ45 ran on a t1 micro aws instance, and there were resources to spare
15:43:27 <bcoca> meetbot is run by fedora infra, iirc
16:02:01 <gundalow> Anything else?
16:02:50 <bcoca> have a fun winter soltice!
16:03:13 <gundalow> Yup
