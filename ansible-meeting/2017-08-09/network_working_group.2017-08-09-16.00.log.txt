16:03:20 <Qalthos> I don't see much on the agenda, so
16:03:28 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:04:35 <Qalthos> anyone have anything they want some attention on here?
16:04:44 <rahushen> Moi
16:05:14 <rahushen> but I can wait for the nxos section
16:05:26 <Qalthos> #topic NX-OS
16:05:39 <Qalthos> rahushen: (:
16:05:54 <rahushen> alrighty then
16:05:57 <rahushen> #26924
16:06:04 <rahushen> PR has been open a while
16:06:34 <Qalthos> I see you made some updates, let me look
16:07:13 <Qalthos> That looks like what I asked for, if tests pass, it'll merge today
16:07:22 <rahushen> awesome!
16:07:36 <Qalthos> rahushen: Thank you so much for your patience
16:07:47 <rahushen> #27935
16:07:51 <rahushen> this is a new one
16:08:44 <rahushen> fixes 2 issues
16:08:46 <Qalthos> If it had tests, I'd have already merged it, but without it I was waiting to have a better look at it
16:08:57 <Qalthos> should be next up
16:09:19 <rahushen> Ah ... we have tests, probably not merged in yet
16:09:47 <Qalthos> If you can commit the tests to that PR, that would be immensely helpful
16:10:13 <Qalthos> If not, I can muddle through it myself
16:10:19 <rahushen> Yes, I'll add that right after this meeting
16:10:24 <Qalthos> anything else?
16:10:41 <rahushen> Issue #26024
16:10:48 <rahushen> this was closed
16:11:03 <rahushen> however I do see an issue with some releases
16:11:19 <rahushen> should be re-opened
16:12:08 <Qalthos> Ah, it was closed from your PR, so I was hoping it was finally done
16:13:24 <rahushen> It's close
16:14:31 <Qalthos> rahushen: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/27329 should fix it, I think
16:15:18 <Qalthos> (I would have merged it after your issue closed, but Shippable is not playing nice)
16:16:06 <rahushen> I'll try it out and update the issue if it indeed fixes it ... I remember trying this PR, not sure if anything has changed recently
16:16:50 <Qalthos> I think that PR always worked, it just didn't fix all of the rest of the issues you ended up fixing
16:17:48 <rahushen> it works for the latest releases of nxos, but the older releases which still need to be supported have a difference way of nvgening event history for size small
16:20:02 <Qalthos> Details on the PR and I'll see what can be done about it.
16:20:53 <rahushen> sounds good
16:22:53 <Qalthos> Anything else?
16:23:27 <rahushen> yeah 2 general discussion items
16:24:21 <rahushen> I see some items that we've marked P1 with a release milestone of 2.5
16:24:42 <rahushen> It should be 2.4
16:26:41 <Qalthos> Complete failures we're trying to keep in 2.4
16:27:25 <rahushen> is that failures with traceback and/or errors ?
16:28:00 <Qalthos> modules mike had previously indicated are lower priority have been sent to 2.5, though I will review to make sure there aren't any that can be pushed forward
16:28:56 <rahushen> that'll be helpful
16:29:17 <Pilou> Could you take a look at #25054 ? This pull-request will allow to use 'ce' doc fragment in cloud_engine modules.
16:31:50 <Qalthos> Pilou: looks like gundalow was looking for a CI pass, so that should be fine
16:31:59 <Qalthos> rahushen: you had one more thing?
16:32:37 <rahushen> Yeah ... just wanted to follow up from Monday's meeting regarding N9Kv adoption for testing
16:33:16 <Qalthos> At the moment, I think you know more about that than I do
16:33:36 <rahushen> The image links have been provided, Peter alluded to us having a working session to get this up and running, but I haven't heard back
16:37:48 <Qalthos> I weill look into getting that particular ball rolling
16:38:13 <rahushen> ok
16:38:20 <rahushen> that's all I had
16:38:56 * skg-net waves
16:39:33 <skg-net> I have just now created a pull request as discussed last week.. to move openswitch to libreswitch
16:39:38 <skg-net> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/27971
16:39:46 <skg-net> please have a look at it..
16:40:31 <skg-net> I haven't renamed the modules since...* the new openswitch have a different short form opx * all the existing tests/playbooks needs to change. * libreswitch community haven't got back on the naming convention.
16:42:04 <Qalthos> #topic Open Floor
16:43:14 <Qalthos> So after this, the module names are going to change at some point?
16:45:05 <skg-net> yes..if the libreswitch team comes up..I can rename the modules and the tests cases..
16:45:08 <Qalthos> Looks good
16:46:20 <skg-net> libreswitch team seemed active couple months before..now..I dont see any activity.
16:47:18 <skg-net> if it continues like that..we can deprecate the modules..as gundalow suggested earlier..
16:49:46 <Qalthos> Righto
16:49:56 <Qalthos> Anyone else?
16:50:34 <skg-net> we are planning to submit the new openswitch modules around october..
16:50:40 <skg-net> thats all I had for today..
16:51:22 <Qalthos> skg-net: Thanks
16:53:53 <Qalthos> Anyone else? We've got 7 minutes left
17:00:07 <Qalthos> Alright, thanks everyone for your time
