19:05:57 * ryansb waves
19:05:59 <ryansb> hey folks
19:06:07 <herve_> hi!
19:06:14 <bcoca> there dont seem to be items for this meeting in agenda, afaict they were all previouslly discussed
19:06:40 <shertel> #chair ryansb
19:06:40 <zodbot> Current chairs: bcoca ryansb shertel
19:06:47 <ryansb> oh, update for folks: 2.4.1 betas will be out in 2 weeks (I think?)
19:06:58 <bcoca> tomorrow, was last i heard
19:07:19 <bcoca> 2.4.1 beta1 being cut
19:07:50 <ryansb> ah, well I was way off. Was 2 weeks the "start thinking about 2.3.3" date?
19:08:11 <ryansb> anyway, 2.4.1 betas will be coming out real soon now, community testing and info is *very welcome*
19:08:12 <agaffney> plm31: just in case you stopped paying attention, it's here, now
19:08:14 <bcoca> not clear on that
19:08:18 <bcoca> #chair agaffney
19:08:19 <zodbot> Current chairs: agaffney bcoca ryansb shertel
19:08:49 <bcoca> #info open floor
19:08:57 <bcoca> #topic open floor
19:09:05 <bcoca> if anyone has anything?
19:09:06 <plm31> If possible I would like to discuss getting a PR for a new module for GitHub Enterprise Organizations accepted, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26071
19:09:50 <bcoca> seems like no one from community reviewed?
19:09:59 <bcoca> anyone here have time to take look?
19:10:09 <plm31> It is new, and I am happy to support it moving forward
19:10:19 <plm31> i.e. become part of said community
19:11:17 <bcoca> plm31: the hard part is finding existing memeber with the time to review, once that is done you automatically become maintainer
19:11:25 <bcoca> unless you want otherwise
19:11:36 <plm31> It unfortunately has been open for a real long time
19:12:01 <bcoca> i'll put it in my queue .. but im pretty much overloaded
19:12:12 <dmsimard> 2.3.3 will be the last dot release for 2.3, yes ?
19:12:16 <shertel> I'll review it this week if no one else gets to it before me.
19:12:20 <bcoca> sorry for the wait ... just need more of the community reviewing
19:12:27 <bcoca> shertel++
19:12:36 <bcoca> dmsimard: last 'planned', yes
19:12:37 <plm31> I would appreciate that
19:12:43 <dmsimard> thanks
19:12:49 <abadger1999> dmsimard: We never 100% know.   (We may do more for security problems)
19:13:00 <abadger1999> Thanks shertel!
19:13:03 <bcoca> #chair abadger1999
19:13:03 <zodbot> Current chairs: abadger1999 agaffney bcoca ryansb shertel
19:13:58 <abadger1999> But in general we'll concentrate on devel and the last released stable version.
19:15:48 <bcoca> well, if no one else has any items i'll close in 5
19:17:42 * ryansb doesn't
19:20:49 <herve_> can you review this PR https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/30707
19:20:56 <herve_> please
19:22:50 <bcoca> herve_: on my list, was planning on writing that .. have inventorymanager(1/2)/data tests already
