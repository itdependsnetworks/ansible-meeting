15:04:43 <gundalow> #topic Python 3 status
15:04:47 <gundalow> abadger1999: You there?
15:04:59 <gundalow> #chair abadger1999 bcoca
15:04:59 <zodbot> Current chairs: abadger1999 bcoca gundalow
15:05:03 <abadger1999> yep
15:06:16 <gundalow> There was some discussion in #ansible-devel regarding having a lightweight doc reporting the status of Python 3 testing
15:06:25 <abadger1999> #topic list for tested status of modules
15:06:50 <alikins> any folks here using ansible on py3 on a daily basis?  (or trying to...)
15:06:59 <abadger1999> misc had the idea to make a public list of modules and list whether they'd been tested with python3.
15:07:03 <abadger1999> I like the idea.
15:07:36 <gundalow> +1
15:08:01 <abadger1999> Not sure where people would like to keep it -- etherpad?  Open to all.  tet document ;  public google doc: you need a google account to access.  Could have a spreadsheet if we did it hre, though
15:08:03 <misc> alikins: i try
15:08:17 <gundalow> There seems to be a few people in the community that are interested in helping out, so tracking what's done/left should make that easier for all
15:08:42 <gundalow> personally I'm leaning towards a gDoc
15:09:07 <gundalow> I *Think* you can create a gDoc and give the anon. edit permissions
15:09:17 <jhawkesworth> There's that projects thing in GitHub too. Might be a bit read only for those without commit access
15:11:01 <misc> I prefer etherpad because it is free, but let's do a gdoc with anonymous access, and if not, a etherpad ?
15:11:02 <abadger1999> yeah, I think the github thing requires commit.  Since most testers won't have commit that'll put a bar in the way of recording the info
15:11:18 <abadger1999> misc: wfm
15:11:50 <jhawkesworth> Cool
15:12:51 <jhawkesworth> Hoping I can start using sooner rather than later as most modules I use are powershell.
15:13:03 <abadger1999> gundalow: Do you want to set up the google doc?
15:14:28 <abadger1999> gundalow: I guess another related question -- do you want the testing group to take charge of it?  (Should we filter people interested in testing python3 support through there?)
15:15:06 <gundalow> yes to both
15:15:33 <abadger1999> Cool
15:15:39 <gundalow> #action gundalow to setup Google Spreadsheet to track Python3 work and circulate in Testing Working Group
15:16:07 <gundalow> #topic ansible/pull/17768 Improve release candidate documentation
15:16:15 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/17768
15:17:45 <bcoca> github wiki?
15:18:10 <bcoca> gundalow:  i think we can close that as it does not reflect the workflow
15:18:58 <alikins> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/17768 changes look reasonable to me
15:19:09 <abadger1999> bcoca: we asked for him to propose changes to the workflow and I think that's how he made the proposal.
15:19:32 <gundalow> What are the actual changes he's proposing?
15:20:01 <bcoca> abadger1999: and we discussed last week and iirc we came to the conclusion that this was not it
15:20:18 <abadger1999> ah... I guess I missed that part of the meeting.  Sorry.
15:20:38 <bcoca> i still agree we need to document it better
15:21:20 <abadger1999> gundalow: Minor change line 33; we will not put minor fixes in to subsequent rcs instead of may not put them in.
15:21:50 <bcoca> nor the way we examine what goes into a release
15:22:08 <abadger1999> 43: Articulate older minor releases for the first time... probably would need a little more info about when is a release "dead"  (no more fixes at all)
15:22:17 <abadger1999> gundalow: 45-48  all new.
15:22:30 <gundalow> From a formatting/readability point of view I wonder if bullet points under each release type may make it easier
15:25:36 <gundalow> So how do we want to progress
15:26:21 <gundalow> approve/disappove each of the changes in turn and provide that as feedback on the PR?
15:29:51 <abadger1999> WE could.
15:30:38 * gundalow wasn't in the previous discussions, so I'm not aware of what was previously agreed
15:31:04 <abadger1999> yeah, me neither
15:31:09 <abadger1999> bcoca: ^ What was decided?
15:31:40 <bcoca> not much, just that it was not the same as current process and that it was unlikely to match short term
15:32:34 <gundalow> Do we want to differ till next week. Will any of this change/be more informed after the repo unification chats
15:32:44 <gundalow> hum, different stuff
15:32:57 * gundalow -> afk
15:33:00 <abadger1999> probably not.
15:33:21 <bcoca> no, branching will still work the same 1vs3 repos does not matter
15:33:26 <abadger1999> (probably won't differ after merge)
15:36:19 <abadger1999> I think we can't make decisions about this without jimi-c
15:36:49 <abadger1999> So I guess defer until a meeting where he is present.
15:36:57 <abadger1999> #topic Open floor
15:36:59 <bcoca> that is what we did 2 last times
15:37:40 <abadger1999> yeah... we'll tel him on slack that this particular issue is waiting for him to be ther too.
15:37:51 <abadger1999> Any other subjects?
15:39:13 <abadger1999> #info 2.2.0rc4 will be out in a few hours
15:39:41 <abadger1999> Okay, I'll close in 60 seconds
15:41:08 <abadger1999> #endmeeting
