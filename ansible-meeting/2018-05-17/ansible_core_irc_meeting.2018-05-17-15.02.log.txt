15:05:52 <bcoca> sdoran: fyi, peopel askign about vars_prompt changes in play
15:05:55 <bcoca> in #ansible
15:06:08 <bcoca> ok, since pettitioner is not present, skipping
15:06:19 <bcoca> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39753
15:06:50 <carchi8py_> sorry to bug you guys with this again, but we are confused at what we need to do to merge this in (we have the shipit, but not way to merge)
15:07:11 <bcoca> iirc shipit only affects modules, you have other files in same PR
15:07:18 <sdoran> bcoca: I have a fix for that, but you didn't like it. So I talked to Jimi and he was like "just rewrite this whole thing over here". So I haven't gotten to that yet.
15:07:20 * jtanner is here but distracted by bluejeans
15:07:20 <sdoran> :)
15:07:47 <carchi8py_> so what do we have to do for the other files?
15:08:09 <bcoca> jtanner:  should  we be allowing shipit on module_utils for owners of 'non core'?
15:08:24 <jtanner> shipit is enabled on all files now. automerge is not
15:08:45 <bcoca> well, that is what we meant, he has shipits but no merge
15:08:51 <jtanner> PR?
15:08:54 <bcoca> probably cause module_utils and doc_fragments are involved
15:09:06 <Pilou> carchi8py_: a core team member need to manually merge the PR
15:09:08 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39753
15:09:18 <jtanner> ah yeah
15:09:22 <carchi8py_> Ya both had a netapp.py where common function where, which we made some changes to.
15:09:25 <bcoca> ^ i dont see a problem for enabling the automerge for these cases
15:09:45 <jtanner> mod utils and docs fragments and new module are all reasons why it won't automerge
15:09:53 <Pilou> new module and non module updates => automerge disabled
15:10:00 <jtanner> nitzmahone has been assigned to ushering the netapp modules in though
15:10:01 <bcoca> ah, missed new module
15:10:09 <bcoca> @nitzmahone_
15:10:32 <jtanner> carchi8py_: you should expect some action from nitzmahone_ this week and next on your PRs
15:11:27 <carchi8py_> ok were hoping to get this module (plus 32 more that require this one to be checked in) as part of 2.6, so we only have a week to make that deadline at this point
15:11:55 <jtanner> nitzmahone_ is the release manager for 2.6, so he'll be able to coordinate that
15:11:58 <nitzmahone_> @carchi8py_ yes, it's been assigned to me. Email is headed your way momentarily about our expectations on that
15:12:07 <nitzmahone_> Actually @mattclay is
15:12:14 <nitzmahone_> (2.6 RM)
15:12:15 <jtanner> err, sorry ...
15:12:21 <nitzmahone_> ETOOMANYMATTS
15:12:30 <jtanner> ETOOMANYRELEASES
15:12:49 <bcoca> ok, i'll let you guys resolve that offline
15:12:51 <maxamillion> "There is no problem that can't be solved by adding more Matts, except for the problem of having too many Matts"
15:12:51 <carchi8py_> ok thank @nitzmahone_
15:12:55 <nitzmahone_> But yeah, I was asked yesterday afternoon to get the NetApp stuff ready to merge
15:13:00 <bcoca> #topic open floor
15:13:49 <Pilou> could we merge this one : https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/35551 ?
15:14:41 <bcoca> aside from my dislike for the corporation, i see no impediment
15:15:15 <bcoca> dont ocfs-tools require debconf settings?
15:16:19 <jtanner> i'm glad that module is community/preview
15:16:49 <Pilou> Ubuntu integration test doesn't seem to require debconf settings
15:18:01 <Pilou> this integration test creates an ocfs2 filesystem
15:19:02 <bcoca> k, going to do manual squash/push cause ... ETOOMANYAUTHORSCOMMITS
15:19:20 <Pilou> thanks
15:19:58 <maxamillion> bcoca++
15:21:17 <bcoca> done
15:23:08 <bcoca> anything else?
