15:08:29 <bcoca> jdelaros1 ?
15:08:51 <jdelaros1> Need this PR merged
15:09:25 * ryansb waves
15:09:35 <bcoca> ryansb: is that you volunteering?
15:09:40 <jdelaros1> You can view discussion in PR itself, but 'shipit' commands not doing it
15:10:01 <ryansb> to see what shipit is failing to do
15:10:32 <jdelaros1> community supported module, I am owner and one of 4 maintainers, but 'shipit' not working because it's in module_utils
15:10:40 <ryansb> ah, I see
15:11:01 <bcoca> yeah, modules will work with shipit, module_utils being 'shared code' does not
15:11:22 <ryansb> thank you for bringing it to our attention, I'll double-check where this gets used, but it's redfish  scoped so it should be fine
15:12:00 <jdelaros1> so can exceptions be made for specific modules? Hate to bother you guys every time a PR is submitted against it
15:12:50 <ryansb> not at the moment, because I don't believe the bot is smart enough to delineate between "module_util used only in XYZ modules" vs. "module_util used everywhere"
15:13:00 <jdelaros1> only 3 modules use it (for now), in modules/remote_management/redfish
15:13:30 <jdelaros1> will it make sense to move it then?
15:13:50 <ryansb> yeah, I see that. I'll merge this one
15:14:12 <ryansb> ah, rebuild_merge because stale_ci
15:14:31 <ryansb> there isn't really a place we have for module shared code other than module_utils
15:15:38 <maxamillion> +1
15:15:40 <bcoca> do we have FR on bot to support this?
15:16:37 <jdelaros1> you mean https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/pull/1046?
15:17:08 <bcoca> that is PR which is more than i hoped
15:18:32 <jdelaros1> FR? If that is something I can submit, happy to, with some direction.
15:18:36 <bcoca> feature request
15:18:42 <ryansb> feature request, on the ansibullbot repo
15:18:52 <bcoca> but that is to get someone to do a PR (pull request) since we have the latter, no need for former
15:19:10 <bcoca> ok, so going to move on, ryansb you'll review/merge this one?
15:19:57 <ryansb> already done, just waiting CI
15:19:59 <bcoca> #topic open floor
15:20:05 <jdelaros1> Thanks all
15:20:08 <ryansb> :)
15:20:30 <mavit> Hello, could someone have a look at reviewing and merging
15:20:30 <mavit> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44113?  It fixes fact-gathering aborting on old versions of Solaris, and I believe should be uncontroversial.
15:29:07 <bcoca> mavit: you can pass optional paths to get_bin_path, no need to construct yourself
15:31:59 <bcoca> you also assume it is there, which might not be the case
15:33:58 <bcoca> put comments on ticket
15:34:04 <bcoca> anythign else?
15:38:42 * ryansb doesn't have more topics
15:40:40 <bcoca> k, that is enough time so
