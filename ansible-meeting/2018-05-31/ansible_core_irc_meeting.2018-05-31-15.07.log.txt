15:16:10 <bcoca> ok, if nothing else, closing meeting in 1 min
15:18:24 <abond> I have something to discuss sorry late to the meeting
15:19:00 <abond> PR#39774
15:19:24 <abond> Adding digital_ocean_space alias for s3_bucket module
15:20:12 <shertel> I think this might jumble the docs and be confusing
15:21:35 <shertel> I'd rather handle this with s3_url in the same way for ceph and fakes3
15:21:54 * shertel finds PR related to this topic that I was recently looking at
15:23:14 <shertel> abond Can you test if this is compatible with digital ocean spaces? https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36832
15:24:46 <shertel> (in theory that should be compatible with walrus still too - but it's not clear if the walrus API is a good drop-in for s3, so I wish that could be tested first to see if it even works on devel currently)
15:26:35 <abond> shertel Thank you, I will test that out.
15:29:09 <shertel> Thanks, abond. This should fix custom endpoints in general rather than adding more special cases. I'm not sure if there are DO docs that would make the AWS module easier to find for those users, but that would be good.
15:30:07 <bcoca> also, #ansible-aws channel might be better for  this discussion, you would not have had to wait for this meeting
