Meeting summary
---------------
* Agenda, feel free to add things
  https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/150  (gundalow, 19:02:26)
* Proposal Process  (gundalow, 19:04:23)
  * Need to work out who has the action to document the proposed
    Proposal Workflow  (gundalow, 19:05:50)
  * the proposal update should be done in a PR which updates
    https://github.com/ansible/proposals/blob/master/proposals_process_proposal.md
    (gundalow, 19:11:10)
  * ACTION: allanice001 has kindly offered to raise a PR to update
    proposals_process_proposal.md  (gundalow, 19:12:49)
  * In the future we can look at moving this under
    docs.ansible.com/ansible/NEWDIR/process_proposal.html (though that's
    not a priority at the moment, and required gundalow to think about
    better names)  (gundalow, 19:13:41)
  * gundalow to move the doc under rst once it's been agreed  (gundalow,
    19:14:18)
  * gundalow wants to create a new docs section for other things, but
    isn't sure what to call it yet, details about our release process,
    proposal process, etc will go there, rather than under dev_guide.
    Need to bikeshed a name  (gundalow, 19:16:46)

* ansible/ansible#18453 "pycrypto not listed in the Python package
  requirements list"  (gundalow, 19:19:22)
  * LINK: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/18453   (gundalow,
    19:19:34)
  * This issue highlighted: 1) Update the requirements in documentation
    2) Prevent future desync between setup.py and docs  (gundalow,
    19:20:13)
  * Sivel suggested: Maybe we could move the requirements to install
    into a requirements.txt file that is referenced by setup.py as well
    as the instructions specifying to utilize the requirements.txt
    instead of listing the packages separately in 2 locations? Just a
    thought, as I've seen this done elsewhere.  (gundalow, 19:21:20)
  * ACTION: abadger and sivel to figure out how to implement docs and
    stup.py using the same requirements.txt to install dependencies.
    (abadger2000, 19:39:27)
  * LINK: https://github.com/google/google-apputils   (bcoca, 19:39:48)

  * LINK: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/21299   (gundalow,
    19:40:36)
  * a) not all modules are idempotent  (gundalow, 19:43:29)
  * b) that can get complicated  (gundalow, 19:43:39)
  * c) notes; already exist as well as you can add to descriptions of
    'state'  (gundalow, 19:43:49)
