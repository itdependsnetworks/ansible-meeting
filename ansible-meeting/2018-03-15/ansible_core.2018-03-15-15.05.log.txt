15:07:23 <dag> o/
15:07:56 <dag> When is v2.5 due ?
15:09:27 <jtanner> i think sometime next week?
15:09:32 <bcoca> 22nd last i heard
15:09:42 <dag> Oh, I was convinced it was today
15:09:50 <bcoca> it was, but new RC
15:10:06 <shertel> hello
15:10:07 <dag> I missed that...
15:10:22 <bcoca> RM decided last night, not sure if it got pushed out yet
15:10:45 <bcoca> he is also traveling, was in automates amsterdam
15:10:51 <jtanner> "rc3 today"
15:10:55 <dag> yup
15:14:57 <mattclay> There was a question about deprecating the helm module previously, but it looked like there wasn't enough time to discuss it before rc2. Has anything changed now that we're having an rc3 today?
15:15:17 <bcoca> guy stepped up to fix it, making the question moot
15:15:46 <bcoca> ^ at least stated intention, we might revise if time passes and no fixes are actually done
15:17:20 <bcoca> soo, if nothing else, ending this in 1 min
15:17:56 <jtanner> nothing for me.
15:18:30 <bcoca> then #endmeeting
15:18:37 <bcoca> #endmeeting
