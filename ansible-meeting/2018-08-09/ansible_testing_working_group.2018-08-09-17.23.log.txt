17:25:26 <gundalow> Pilou: Good work on refactoring this
17:26:35 <gundalow> mattclay: Does that look OK to you?
17:26:58 <Pilou> with this one it should be easier to add tests for other docker modules
17:27:18 <mattclay> Pilou:  Nice work. That's a significant improvement.
17:29:47 <mattclay> Pilou gundalow: PR approved.
17:37:18 <mattclay> Pilou: 42306 is merged
17:37:24 <gundalow> Thansk!
17:37:42 <gundalow> Pilou: Backport PRs will get merged by Release manager
17:38:07 <mattclay> Pilou: That backport looks good, but could use a changelog fragment.
17:38:26 <Pilou> should i use "minor_changes" or "bugfixes" in the fragment ?
17:41:22 <mattclay> Pilou: Actually, ignore that request. I didn't look close enough to see that it's only touching test files.
17:41:43 <Pilou> ok
17:42:01 <mattclay> Pilou: merged
17:45:07 <gundalow> \o/
17:45:31 <gundalow> Pilou: Out of interest, what's next on your roadmap?
