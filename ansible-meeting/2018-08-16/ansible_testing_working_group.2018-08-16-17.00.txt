Meeting summary
---------------
* Core Testing update  (gundalow, 17:04:58)
  * work continues on getting Zuul to test ansible/ansible, this is
    currently running on `ansible/zuul-test-repo` (fork).  (gundalow,
    17:06:18)
  * Currently working on using `groupsN` to allow jobs to be run in
    parallel, like we do with Windows in Shippable  (gundalow, 17:07:00)
  * Once that is done I'm looking at two state process for identifying
    and running tests against PRs that affect multiple network platforms
    (gundalow, 17:08:23)
  * integration test container repositories (`ansible/*-test-container`)
    now include basic CI for the docker builds (except the
    `acme-test-container`, which will be enabled later)  (mattclay,

  * LINK:
    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commits/devel/test/utils/docker
    Not much traffic  (gundalow, 17:36:13)

    version in `docker.txt`  (gundalow, 18:04:02)
