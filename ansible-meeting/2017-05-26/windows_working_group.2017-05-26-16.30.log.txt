16:32:21 <nitzmahone> Looks like it could be a quiet one
16:32:37 <jhawkesworth> ha, I was just typing the same thing!
16:33:13 <nitzmahone> You might care about this: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/25012
16:33:48 <jhawkesworth> I wondered if dag might make it as he added an item this week
16:33:58 <nitzmahone> Persistence/KEEP_REMOTE should be working again in 2.3.1, though the wad we're dropping isn't very debuggable at the moment.
16:34:26 <nitzmahone> We needed the non-pipelined path to make rackspace's awsrun and future azure connection plugins work again on Windows
16:34:36 <jhawkesworth> dammit, netsplits
16:34:48 <nitzmahone> We can hang out for a couple more minutes and see if anyone else comes
16:35:21 <jhawkesworth> sounds like a plan.  train packed, trouble getting  cell signal tonight
16:35:36 <nitzmahone> I have a couple of tests to fix up for that one before I merge, but it's moving along, anyway. Holiday weekend through Monday, and I'm probably taking the rest of today off (recovering from a week of pycon + sprints)
16:35:48 <nitzmahone> Welp, let's just call it a week then.
16:37:01 <nitzmahone> Have a good one!
16:37:03 <jhawkesworth> yeah.  wounds up doing support for most of this week.  will have a win_get_url PR shortly after crazy discovery
16:37:21 <jhawkesworth> yeah hope you get a decent break
16:37:22 <nitzmahone> Cool- I'll be on the lookout starting Tuesday. :)
