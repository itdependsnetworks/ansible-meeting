  * Ansible 2.3 Networking: We’ve introduced new performance upgrades
    and additional vendor support. For more information about what’s new

    https://www.ansible.com/blog/networking-features-in-ansible-2-3
    (gundalow, 16:04:39)
  * Lots of new Modules, 267 network modules, thanks to everyone that's
    help with that
    http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html
    (gundalow, 16:05:33)
  * We are tracking a handful of issues for this release candidate that
    we expect to have fixed by the time we release version 2.3; you can
    monitor the list of known issues
    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3A2.3.0%20label%3Anetworking
    (gundalow, 16:06:40)
  * Please do test RC1 when it's released, *any* issues please raise in
    GitHub  (gundalow, 16:07:01)
  * Unless there is a bug raised, the issue doesn't exist :)  (gundalow,
    16:17:53)
  * ACTION: gundalow to get some wording generated about how the new
    ephemeral state modules and why that means we split things into
    smaller modules (ios_config -> ios_banner)  (gundalow, 16:22:43)

* Network Documentation  (gundalow, 16:24:22)
  * we know we've spent a lot of time in 2.3 improving how the modules
    can be used, though with a few late blocks of refactoring this has
    taken time away from adding in more documentation about how to use
    the modules  (gundalow, 16:25:25)
  * We have (hopefully) make the `provider:` option easier, this change
    https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gundalow/4bdc3669d696268328ccc18528cc6718/raw/98ce795a41035810133228ebc747ed201911ca21/nested-provider.png
    should be being live on docs.ansible.com later today  (gundalow,
    16:26:31)
  * in 2.3 you don't need to give `provider`, we will support network
    modules, ssh keys & inventory files in the usual way we do with
    Linux machines  (gundalow, 16:28:58)
  * Network modules will need to be updated to take advantage of
    Persistent Connection  (gundalow, 16:36:09)
  * for 2.3 the modules that ship with Ansible will support Persistent
    Connect: eos_*, ios_*, iosxr_*, junos_*, and vyos_*.  (gundalow,
    16:38:19)
  * sros_* also, but that's not in RC1  (gundalow, 16:38:36)
  * Some of the nxos_* modules, but not all (their are a lot of them)
    (gundalow, 16:38:52)
  * WIP for debug guide
    https://github.com/gundalow/ansible/blob/bcf6934c3eb1a85f607f4e1210c28c242c0bc767/docs/docsite/rst/network_debug_troubleshooting.rst
    (gundalow, 16:41:15)
  * Default (without provider (or transport)) is ssh, you can still
    specify `transport: eapi` (or `provider:\n  transport: eapi`)
    (gundalow, 16:43:03)

* Module changes  (gundalow, 16:51:27)
  * This (smaller specific modules) has always been the long term plan
    to start with the overall config first and then start to seed more
    specific stateful modules  (gundalow, 16:52:29)
  * Its a natural evolution of how we plan to support network devices,
    for some features (such as banners) we can better support it in a
    specific module as opposed to a more generic config module.
    (gundalow, 16:53:05)
  * Longer term we want to be able to support a role call "banner" (for
    instance) that can abstract away the device os  (gundalow, 16:53:26)

* Open Floor  (gundalow, 16:54:39)
