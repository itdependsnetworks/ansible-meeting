16:03:16 <privateip> hi all
16:03:29 <phildileo> Hey Peter
16:03:43 <daemoniz> ayyyy
16:04:13 <grybak> Hello
16:04:46 <gundalow> Anyone have anything for the Agenda today?
16:05:08 <privateip> i have one thing (sorry i know i said i had nothing)
16:05:12 <privateip> :)
16:05:30 <gundalow> privateip: cool, #topic and it's all yours :)
16:05:48 <privateip> i wanted to give everyone an update on 2.2 networking refactor
16:06:08 <privateip> as many of you have noted we are going through a fairly major refactoring of the networking shared module code
16:06:11 <gundalow> #topic 2.2 networking refactor
16:06:21 <privateip> to take advantage of ziploader introduced int 2.1
16:06:40 <privateip> ultimately this will greatly simply both the code base and the ability to test it
16:07:05 <privateip> as we work through this networking will occasionally break in devel
16:07:17 <privateip> please just bear with us on this as we work through the issues
16:07:36 <privateip> we will do our best to minimize any disruptions
16:07:53 <privateip> as you see things, please file bug reports via the std issues process
16:08:37 <privateip> unless there are any questions, thats all i have for today
16:08:59 <gundalow> #info Large refactor taking place to make use of the ziploaded work in 2.1. This will result in much cleaner and easier code that we can test. No doubt that things will break. Please report issues via the usual way
16:09:24 <phildileo> Is there documentation on ziploader?
16:09:45 <phildileo> It's new to me
16:10:03 <privateip> yes
16:10:12 <privateip> lol if i could only find the link
16:10:33 <privateip> http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/developing_program_flow_modules.html#ansiballz
16:10:53 <phildileo> great!
16:10:56 <ttom> how are these changes expected to affect network equipment that's managed via transports other than ssh/telnet? like http/s?
16:11:50 <privateip> on the surface no changes, everything will continue to just work ... under the covers though we have remove copious amounts of duplicate code so we can better test moving forward
16:14:50 <privateip> one other note
16:14:58 <gundalow> #topic newblood
16:15:07 <privateip> i want to "officially" introduce you all to gundalow

16:16:24 <gundalow> Glad to be offically part of the team
16:16:26 <privateip> he will be driving this weekly meeting moving froward
16:16:30 <privateip> forward*
16:16:37 <privateip> with that ... over to you gundalow
16:16:43 <gundalow> Thanks privateip
16:17:43 <gundalow> So I'll be initially looking at the community side, how to help you lovely people and improving the QA side of things
16:18:11 <gundalow> One of the first things I'll be looking at is documentation
16:18:28 * privateip claps
16:18:30 <gundalow> As a recap the main things are
16:18:40 <gundalow> 1) https://www.ansible.com/network-automation
16:18:48 <gundalow> 2)  http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_networking.html
16:19:07 <gundalow> 3) Individual network modules documentation (subset of http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html)
16:19:38 <gundalow> looking at what gaps we have, what could be better explained, etc
16:20:27 <gundalow> So if there has been anything that hasn't been clear then feel free to ping me on here (direct message is fine) or throw github tickets and @gundalow them so I'll see them
16:21:14 <gundalow> So that's it from me
16:21:23 <gundalow> #topic open floor
16:21:42 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else their like to raise, or any documentation issues?
16:21:47 <phildileo> One quick thing is that the module examples don't mention 'provider' or any connection params.  Also, it would be good if the modules mentioned connection: local
16:22:42 <gundalow> privateip: excellent. What's your github so I'll make sure you see the review?
16:23:04 <phildileo> phil-dileo
16:23:14 <gundalow> cool
16:23:32 <grybak> I am grybak-arista, if you don't mind adding me as well.
16:25:21 <gundalow> cool, I'll make sure any sizable PRs get mentioned on here
16:26:01 <gundalow> I've created a standing agenda (rather one per meeting), feel free to subscribe to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110 to receive updates
16:26:07 <gundalow> anyone got anything else
16:28:37 <gundalow> Cool. So I guess we'll close the meeting now
16:28:45 <gundalow> No meeting next week
16:28:52 <gundalow> or maybe the week after
