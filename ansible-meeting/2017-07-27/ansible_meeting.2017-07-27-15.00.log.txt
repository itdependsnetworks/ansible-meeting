15:08:03 <thaumos> @abadger1999, I noticed I missed this one on Tues, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17962
15:08:40 <abadger1999> You didn't miss it; I added it post-meeting
15:08:44 <thaumos> gotcha
15:08:46 <thaumos> kk
15:08:49 <abadger1999> Good to discuss now, thouhg :-)

15:10:01 <abadger1999> So there's a PR requesting to update the callback plugin API to let the triggers that are errors use stderr instead of stdout.
15:10:25 <bcoca> well, not errors 'failed', there is a bit of a difference there
15:10:43 <abadger1999> yeah... something of a difference.
15:10:56 <abadger1999> i don't think it's precisely correct but there's several different ways we could go with it.
15:11:10 <abadger1999> Probably best to read what I wrote here: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/17962#issuecomment-317839947
15:12:42 <abadger1999> We need to first decide if we want callbacks to use stderr, then decide if so, how we want this implementation to be changed.
15:13:39 <bcoca> i want to extend callbacks to handle all output
15:13:51 <bcoca> but they cannot in current implementation
15:14:11 <mattclay> bcoca: +1 to callbacks handling all output
15:14:51 <bcoca> they need (at least main one) to be loaded earlier, then have most of what we use 'display' for now send an 'event'
15:15:41 <bcoca> another issue, display is currently very expensive
15:15:46 <abadger1999> bcoca: <nod> Okay.  And if it's handling all output then it should be able to handle stderr in some shape or form as well.
15:15:56 <abadger1999> I'm not sure if a callback makes sense though...
15:16:20 <abadger1999> Debugging, for isntance, isn't conceptually "an event has occurred"... it's more of "here's some info that may be helpful"
15:16:46 <bcoca> debugging is not normal output, but vvv stuff is
15:17:03 <abadger1999> yeah,  I think for the most part vvv would be.
15:17:25 <abadger1999> does vvv need to handle stderr though?
15:17:26 <bcoca> but can be convinced that all -v + debug be outside of this as it is not normal operation
15:17:36 <bcoca> no, -v is info, stdout
15:17:42 <bcoca> warning/deprecation/error is stderr
15:18:47 <bcoca> but display.display .. we can probably agree should all be changed into 'events'
15:20:42 <abadger1999> okay.  So you do think warning, deprecation, and error are stderr and should be handled by callbacks i nthe future?
15:21:58 <bcoca> when possible
15:22:14 <bcoca> thinking 'top fatal errors' wont be (i.e. initializing cli)
15:22:27 <abadger1999> bcoca: so when you implement callbacks for the rest of the events, does the proposed changes to the API look compatible with that goal?  Or does it look like it would make it uglier?
15:23:11 <bcoca> really does not change what he is trying to do, since most of it would be new events and the currrent ones would still be as is
15:23:53 <bcoca> essentially he wants to force 'failed tasks' to be 'errors' in output, i would not do this by default but fine having a callback that does it
15:24:34 <abadger1999> <nod>  yeah, I'm okay with a callback doing it too... but it seems like the real question is whether hte API change is a good idea or not.
15:24:57 <abadger1999> because he could do it 100% in the callback if we don't want to change the API.
15:25:05 <bcoca> i would say no, no need to change default api to allow for this when callback can do it itself, he just wants it cause its less code on his side
15:25:33 <abadger1999> Cool.  I'll vote for that as well.
15:25:48 <mattclay> +1 to not changing the default api
15:25:57 <abadger1999> Proposal: callbacks using stderr is fine.  But do it without changing the default API
15:26:08 <abadger1999> Currently for: bcoca, mattclay abadger1999
15:26:15 <thaumos> +1
15:27:22 <abadger1999> unanimously +4, I think that's a pretty solid yes.
15:27:32 <abadger1999> I'll update the PR ticket.
15:27:36 <thaumos> thx!
15:27:48 <thaumos> #action abadger1999 to update ticket with decision.

15:30:06 <mattclay> Nice, it has tests. :)
15:30:34 <thaumos> @bcoca wanted to group_by us into feedback
15:30:47 <bcoca> meed to write that propsal, i got some code that moves callback to 'cli/__init__ .. but need clear desgin
15:34:44 <thaumos> This group_by PR lgtm
15:34:56 <abadger1999> code looks fine.  No opinion on the feature itself.  If bcoca likes the feature then +1 from me.
15:36:29 <jtanner> shipit
15:36:48 <thaumos> cool
15:37:13 <bcoca> k, will merge
15:37:25 <thaumos> #action bcoca to merge

15:39:20 <bcoca> not sure what the doubt is here
15:39:20 <abadger1999> In some circumstances the fetch module is currently fetching a file but then reporting that it errored.
15:39:35 <abadger1999> there's definitely a bug there but we need to decide what that is
15:39:37 <bcoca> cause checksum fail if dir was specified w/o trailing /?
15:39:44 <abadger1999> The choices are:
15:39:55 <abadger1999> * Do not download the ifle in this case
15:40:03 <abadger1999> * Report success i nthis case.
15:40:06 <bcoca> if dest is dir w/o slash?
15:40:25 <abadger1999> Yes... flatten=True dest=/a/directory/with/no/trailing/slash
15:40:38 <bcoca> i would say 1 as it is not clear if user wants file with that name instead
15:41:00 <bcoca> but fine with 2 also, since many utilities will 'infer' that you want fiel in dir
15:41:08 <jtanner> i still think it should check if dir and then fail early
15:41:09 <bcoca> so +0 either way
15:41:14 <abadger1999> Cool.  jtanner also thought that was the more obvious option.
15:41:45 <abadger1999> So looks like a mild +2 for "do not download the file."
15:41:48 <jtanner> s/obvious/makes fewer assumptions
15:41:57 <bcoca> true, that is why i slightly lean on that side
15:42:10 <bcoca> fail early, fail loud
15:42:27 <thaumos> error on the side of caution.
15:42:32 <thaumos> loudl
15:42:33 <thaumos> y
15:43:05 <abadger1999> Cool.  I'll update the bug report and possibly look at fixing it (depends on how much time I have coming up) with that choice.
15:43:12 <bcoca> the other option si 'nicer' to most users that forget the /, but is inconvinent to those that meant it to be a file
15:43:22 <thaumos> üëç @abadger1999
15:43:25 <bcoca> abadger1999: yeah, low priority on this one
15:43:41 <bcoca> abadger1999: mark it easy fix and explain desired fix
15:43:47 <abadger1999> bcoca: will do
15:44:11 <thaumos> #action abadger1999 to update issue with discussion details
15:44:32 <thaumos> #topic Open Floor
15:44:34 <jtanner> mkrizek might be able to do that one
15:44:59 <jtanner> or sdoran once he's back
15:45:13 <abadger1999> SOunds good.
15:45:49 <bcoca> just following your 'want' for "easy fix"  bugs to throw at new contributors, this is clearly in that category
15:46:52 <thaumos> anything else anyone want's to cover?
15:48:48 <thaumos> alrighty, thanks everyone!
15:48:49 <mkrizek> abadger1999: feel free to throw it at me ;)
