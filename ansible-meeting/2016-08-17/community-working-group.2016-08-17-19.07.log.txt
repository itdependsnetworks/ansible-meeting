19:07:50 <gregdek> #topic Roll Call
19:07:59 <alikins> blippy
19:08:17 <rbergeron> i'm more into croissants than rolls, personally
19:09:25 <gregdek> Agenda, comme toujours: https://waffle.io/ansible/community
19:09:38 <gregdek> OK, let's blow thru this thang.
19:09:44 <rbergeron> OUI
19:09:47 <gregdek> #topic Planning for Contributor Conference Brooklyn
19:09:55 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/115
19:10:19 <rbergeron> whee!
19:10:21 <gregdek> Updated!
19:10:26 <gregdek> Any questions?
19:10:30 <rbergeron> So I'm on the hook for putting that in hubspot.
19:10:34 <gregdek> Yeppers.
19:10:41 <rbergeron> and i expect you to harass me about it in the morning.
19:10:46 <rbergeron> LIKE A BOSS
19:10:48 <rbergeron> literally
19:11:01 <gregdek> Will do!
19:11:05 <rbergeron> thanks!
19:11:07 <rbergeron> next?
19:11:34 <gregdek> #topic Ansiblefest SF recap
19:11:45 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/93
19:11:54 <gregdek> Blog post done, waiting on Anna to post
19:11:56 <rbergeron> I think we're waiting on annaucbo's draft :)
19:12:03 <gregdek> Er, draft, yes
19:12:03 <rbergeron> or to post
19:12:06 <rbergeron> or draft! yes
19:12:15 * rbergeron gets a giant cup of tea
19:12:27 <gregdek> And once that's done, we're done with that item.
19:12:30 <gregdek> Next:
19:12:42 <gregdek> #topic Module Maintainer Guidelines
19:13:07 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/81
19:13:25 <gregdek> We've got a new draft in, just need to clean up some other stuff...
19:13:50 <rbergeron> yeah, cleaning up.
19:14:15 <gregdek> Should we ask alikins to submit his changes as a PR to this file?
19:14:51 <rbergeron> ummm
19:15:02 <rbergeron> so - i think maybe a lot of that could still just go in ...
19:15:04 * rbergeron looks
19:15:16 <gregdek> If you want to Just Do It, that's fine too.
19:15:29 <rbergeron> well, i'll finish saying why -- because the same guidelines apply even if you're just submiting a PR to someone else's module.
19:15:47 <rbergeron> and if you'er not a maintainer, you might wind up missing some of that context.
19:15:56 <rbergeron> iirc. was my line of thinking
19:16:11 <rbergeron> but -- open to just having him do a PR to that file as well :)
19:16:46 <gregdek> You tell me the right answer. :)
19:17:06 <rbergeron> I think it might be best in the ...
19:17:15 <gregdek> ...
19:17:19 <gregdek> ...
19:17:22 <gregdek> !!!
19:17:28 <gregdek> ???
19:17:35 <gregdek> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
19:17:46 <rbergeron> ughhhhhhh
19:18:13 <rbergeron> i don't know. i want to say "OMG so much redundancy" but it seems like a lot to untangle and fix, before we then ... have to sort out the core / extras stuff.
19:18:23 <gregdek> Is this doc sprint material?
19:18:40 <alikins> I'll do a pr, though maybe not soon
19:19:28 <rbergeron> gregdek: actually, probably, yeah. (i mean, the whole of the core / extras stuff probably is.)
19:19:47 <rbergeron> actually, i think this stuff from alikins is probably fine in guidelines.md
19:20:09 <gregdek> Then let's do that. If you can pull it in so alikins doesn't have to mess with the PR, so much the better.
19:20:26 <rbergeron> yeah
19:20:32 <rbergeron> um, also: i do'nt think my PR has been merged?
19:20:44 <gregdek> It hasn't?
19:20:52 <gregdek> What's the PR id?
19:21:08 <rbergeron> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2710
19:22:05 <gregdek> abadger1999 bcoca any reason we can't just merge this new GUIDELINES.md file into extras?
19:22:37 <gregdek> It's just a new top level text file, so I would just merge, but I vaguely remember some reason for being careful with top-level files like that...?
19:22:52 * abadger1999 checks
19:23:43 <abadger1999> gregdek: I think it will be okay if it's not a directory and doesn't end in .py or .ps1.... I say merge it to devel only -- we'll find out pretty quickly if there's a problem.
19:24:02 <gregdek> ok will do, thx!
19:24:41 <gregdek> Done.
19:24:59 <rbergeron> WOOO
19:25:20 <rbergeron> okay, then i'll make a PR to that. Unless things go awry.
19:25:21 <gregdek> ok, next?
19:25:23 <gregdek> Yep.

19:25:54 <gregdek> newtMcKerr: any update on ^^^?
19:27:13 <gregdek> I'll say that's a "no" for now.
19:27:18 <rbergeron> :)
19:27:20 <newtMcKerr> JCTanner is working on a bunch of this stuff and has it coming along.  Data and graphs.
19:27:33 <gregdek> okeydoke!
19:27:37 <newtMcKerr> not sure if I’m allowed to post those yet :)
19:27:37 <gregdek> Should I reassign to him?
19:27:40 <newtMcKerr> yes please.
19:27:44 <gregdek> will do, thx!
19:28:00 <gregdek> jtanner|t420: you're now on the hook for that one :)
19:28:16 * jtanner|t420 reads up
19:28:37 <jtanner|t420> https://jctanner.github.io/

19:28:57 <jtanner|t420> updated ~hourly
19:29:22 <gregdek> I'm so glad there's an actual engineer working on this stuff now.
19:29:23 <jtanner|t420> i broke the galaxy one, but i'll fix it soon
19:29:30 <newtMcKerr> (thanks tanner, didn’t think those were for public consumption yet)
19:29:39 <newtMcKerr> er…thanks :)
19:29:40 <rbergeron> fun!
19:29:40 <jtanner|t420> it's public data, so i don't mind
