19:09:09 <sdoran> That's pretty fantastic.
19:09:16 <maxamillion> he is legend
19:09:17 <schmots> that is funny
19:09:22 <bcoca> im not sure what is more impressive, 0.1% earned or that it was earned 34 times
19:09:34 <maxamillion> I just realized I don't have it, I thought I did
19:09:47 <jtanner> it's now required for principal promotions
19:09:48 <maxamillion> maybe I need to get that fixed ... or maybe it wasn't a Fedora event
19:09:51 <bcoca> ^ i 1/2 earned it, was not fedora event
19:10:34 <bcoca> ok,if no real business, im closing meeting in 1 min
