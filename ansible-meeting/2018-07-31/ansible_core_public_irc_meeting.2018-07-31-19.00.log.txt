19:01:36 <bcoca> @qalthos , thanks ... i think my imaginary cat was on my keyboard for a sec
19:01:53 <bcoca> +1 to this one, probably the only style update that is not hard to review nor messes attribution
19:01:59 <abadger1999> Cool.
19:02:44 <bcoca> any one else in favor/against?
19:02:49 <bcoca> comments welcome
19:02:59 <abadger1999> four +1s and no -1s so this seems pretty uncontroversial :-)
19:03:15 <bcoca> weird math with only 2 people ?

19:05:23 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos abadger1999 bcoca gundalow jdelaros1 ryansb sdoran shertel
19:05:43 <ryansb> bcoca: anything is cloud if you market it hard enough
19:06:00 <bcoca> i would say, its all water vapor ...
19:06:00 <schmots> hehe
19:06:23 <jdelaros1> redfish is HW management. sdoran reviewed first PR, but would not want to volunteer him again if he doesn't want to :)
19:06:39 <bcoca> ah, k, its a mgmt api
19:06:41 <jdelaros1> But fresh in his mind, I'm sure
19:07:11 <bcoca> jdelaros1: you can normally ping us in ansilbe-devel to finish reviews, if he does not have the time he would let you know
19:07:21 <bcoca> sdoran: you have bandwith?
19:07:36 <jdelaros1> I see, this are new PRs though
19:07:37 <sdoran> Yeah, I've been working with him.
19:07:46 <bcoca> k, leaving it in your hands
19:07:51 <bcoca> #topic open floor
19:09:06 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/39 <= since we have been having chatter about this
19:09:50 <bcoca> i would like to submitt for approval next week, so if those interested want to give it a read/feedback/discussion/etc ...
19:10:20 <bcoca> seems like most would like the feature, but implementing it in a way that other features can leverage it would  be nice
19:12:04 <bcoca> ok, if nothing else closing meeting in 1min
