    08:50:54)
  * ppl are expecting us to be grown-ups, vendors want to know how to
    get their modules "certified" ; hopefully this will be
    generalize-a-bull  (rbergeron, 08:51:16)
  * working on a generalized process for this  (jimi|ansible, 08:51:19)
  * ansible is the shizz  (jimi|ansible, 08:51:38)
  * we have a ton of modules; thaumos thinks we can't test them all;
    mordred and rbergeron disagree but it's a detail to get to later
    :DDDDDDDD  (rbergeron, 08:51:55)
  * this is acknowlegment that Ansible is partially a platform for
    people to write and support their modules on.  Need to make it
    easier for people/organizations to get involved that way.
    (abadger1999, 08:52:51)

* Questions?  (abadger1999, 08:53:03)

    (rbergeron, 08:57:04)
  * except with ... bettter testing of my typing  (rbergeron, 08:57:14)
  * Tima has question on certified modules: how to handle "certified
    modules" from the community  (rbergeron, 08:58:33)
  * has there been discussion of vendors who want to maintain modules
    but a module already exists that has been contributed by a community
    contributor.  (abadger1999, 08:58:34)
  * tima was just outed as the synchronize module guy. :D IN THE CORNER
    FOLKS :)  (rbergeron, 08:59:28)

    (gundalow, 09:04:28)

    (rbergeron, 09:11:02)
  * (inaudiblenoise as jmckerr walks in and gregdek expects donuts)

  * question: how's thing's goin for y'all? (says gregdek)  (rbergeron,
    09:12:07)
  * tomas just submitted his first PR; hasn't gotten any feedback.
    (rbergeron, 09:13:14)
  * jlk needs more direction on how to do bot commands / labelling
    (jimi|ansible, 09:13:33)
  * jlk indicates labels / process / etc. for new folks (esp on modules)
    could be way more clear. Some of that is moved into the docs for the
    bot itself  (rbergeron, 09:13:40)
  * resmo is saying that maintainer of module has less power in the new
    workflow (because the bot needs more than just the maintainer to
    approve PRs)  (abadger1999, 09:17:36)
  * make the bot more friendly, and make sure it's always posting links
    to bot documentation  (jimi|ansible, 09:17:44)
  * a number of processes have gone from explicit to implicit
    (gundalow, 09:18:40)

    always posting links to bot documentation  (jimi|ansible, 09:21:10)

    interest groups  (rbergeron, 09:22:39)
  * ACTION: gregdek and nitzmahone to look at how to better use the new
    GitHub permissions. For example ping @ansible-bsd group  (gundalow,
    09:23:58)
  * gregdek types into etherpad things he could type here  (rbergeron,
    09:25:07)
  * Nested groups and read-only collaborators in Github might be super
    useful to help with the "BSD" problem (spread out modules that
    aren't well namespaced but need a group of collaborators to help
    fix)  (rbergeron, 09:25:38)
  * robyn cuts and pastes for greg  (rbergeron, 09:25:45)
  * improvements to github continue to be nice. but then it also makes
    us need to rereview the entirety of everything every single time
    something changes  (rbergeron, 09:26:26)
  * IDEA: having a fixed slot / time of year to reconsider / rereview
    tooling would be nice (from hyperized)  (rbergeron, 09:27:43)
  * gregdek types into etherpad: (how do we make sure this is the bat
    signal and not the "everybody gets pinged all the time" thing)
    (https://github.com/blog/2378-nested-teams-add-depth-to-your-team-structure)
    (rbergeron, 09:28:41)
  * discussion about having github alias/group/etc that is a directed
    quesetion "We need someone with expertise in XXX to look at this
    issue" rather than "Here's a XXX bug that you might be interested
    in"  (abadger1999, 09:29:23)

    contains sig information.  (abadger1999, 09:39:05)

    create and manage SIGs. Enable Wiki on ansible/community.

    (gundalow, 09:39:45)
  * gregdek proposing giving out commit on ansible/community to anyone
    who asks.  (abadger1999, 09:39:48)
  * ACTION: plagiarize kubernetes for sigs and wikis  (jimi|ansible,
    09:40:26)
  * gregdek proposing turning on wiki in the ansible/community space.
    (Identify owners for wiki spaces who are responsible for cleaning up
    old pages)  (abadger1999, 09:41:56)
  * greg defining what he thinks a SIG is: lightweight body that allows
    people to collaborate on common interests together.  (abadger1999,
    09:47:20)
  * ACTION: write up onboard for each SIG  (gundalow, 09:54:35)
  * LINK:
    https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-june-2017-backlog
    (rbergeron, 10:16:42)
  * ACTION: gundalow to speak to jtanner to see if we can get the stats
    he collects public  (gundalow, 10:22:05)
  * the average time for a PR to work through the process is an
    important stat  (gundalow, 10:24:25)

    that file.  (abadger1999, 10:28:49)

    (gundalow, 10:29:05)

    as an example I'm most familiar with)  (willthames, 10:29:46)
  * We are currently working on adding docs and metadata to other
    plugins  (gundalow, 10:29:55)
  * modules that have a specific maintainer then do not fall under group
    maintainance.  (abadger1999, 10:32:49)
  * greg talking about potential to create a triage sig  (abadger1999,
    10:34:54)
  * Getting reproducers from issues is one of the biggest problems.
    (jlk, 10:36:33)
  * IDEA: Have a metrics SIG if there are people who care about metrics
    and want to use math to start figuring ot what the sources of
    problems are rather than bikeshedding? :)  (rbergeron, 10:39:09)
  * shipit_on_tests_passing might be a useful bot flag :)  (willthames,
    10:41:26)
  * Discussion about how the bot can discourage a submitter because the
    bot will autodetect problems and make the contributer do things.
    But then if the maintainer (core or community) isn't actually
    looking at the PRs then the submitter did all this work for no
    apparent end ability to merge.  (abadger1999, 10:46:19)
  * zuul will fix everything  (jimi|ansible, 10:46:36)

    stats  (jimi|ansible, 10:58:13)

    (rbergeron, 12:03:29)
  * gundalow giving out information about testing.  (abadger1999,
    12:05:30)
  * 2.3 => devel, large percentage increase in coverage for both
    integration and unit tests.  But we started from a low number of
    tests to begin with so still a large amount to do  (abadger1999,
    12:07:02)
  * problems to overcome: test instability  (abadger1999, 12:07:13)
  * tests that talk to external resources that go away (like installing
    packages from external package resource)  (abadger1999, 12:07:41)

    windows)  (abadger1999, 12:14:33)
  * ACTION: gundalow to look for both simple and complex examples for
    reference integration tests.  (abadger1999, 12:20:34)
  * stale_ci label: added to tickets if ci hasn't been run in ~7 days.
    meant to tell committers to trigger a new ci run before merging.
    (abadger1999, 12:22:17)

    (jlk, 12:24:56)
  * mattclay says that it is a known feature request to add a bot
    command to rerun ci but it hasn't been written yet.  (abadger1999,

    implement.  (abadger1999, 12:26:16)
  * remember, 2.3 needs python-2.4 module-side compat.  (abadger1999,
    12:27:38)

    See a make test and it doesn't work.  etc.  (abadger1999, 12:37:16)

    help with that for pypi packages.  (abadger1999, 12:40:53)

    things like code which could raise multiple exceptions and we're
    only testing that it catches one of those.  (abadger1999, 13:01:09)
