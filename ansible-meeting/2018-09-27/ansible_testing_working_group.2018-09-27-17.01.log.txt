17:02:59 <zodbot> Current chairs: gundalow mattclay
17:03:59 <Pilou> yep
17:04:39 <mattclay> We're still working on being able to run newer distributions in CI.
17:05:03 * gundalow waves
17:05:42 <mattclay> There are issues, including conflicts between docker and systemd versions that have made updating to newer distributions difficult.
17:06:24 <Pilou> wasn't the last build of #27795 successful ?
17:07:04 <mattclay> Pilou: Yes, but only on a newer node type that has issues with other tests.
17:07:24 <mattclay> We're still working through those issues so we can switch to the newer nodes.
17:08:06 <Pilou> shippable node type ?
17:08:13 <mattclay> We've been able to resolve most of the other test issues, but one thing we're still dealing with is a significant decrease in node performance.
17:08:15 <mattclay> Pilou: Yes
17:10:15 <mattclay> jborean93 has been working on resolving the test issues and identifying where the performance issues are so we can figure out how to address them.
17:11:30 <mattclay> Pilou: Did you have any other questions?
17:23:38 <mattclay> Pilou: If you have any other questions about running newer distributions in CI, let me know.
