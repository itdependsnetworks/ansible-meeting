15:03:21 <maxamillion> hrmmm... the bot isn't awake
15:03:43 <gundalow> .hello2
15:03:51 <bcoca> alikins: i believe you are now partial to having meta/requirements.yml ?
15:03:53 <gundalow> can't remember, do we need to be `#chair`?
15:04:08 <bcoca> we can, im still unclear what it actually does
15:04:12 <zodbot> maxamillion: maxamillion 'Adam Miller' <maxamillion@gmail.com>
15:04:15 <sdoran> I had to rejoin all my channels so maybe they changed something due to spam and the bot needs to rejoin.
15:04:25 <maxamillion> I think people with `#chair` can set topics and stuff
15:04:26 <bcoca> probably
15:04:30 <zodbot> gundalow: gundalow 'John Barker' <john@johnrbarker.com>
15:04:36 <sdoran> There is goes.
15:04:48 <sivel> .hello2
15:04:51 <zodbot> sivel: sivel 'Matt Martz' <matt@sivel.net>
15:06:54 <alikins> bcoca: I like the idea, but cant speak for galaxy in general
15:07:32 <bcoca> i just saw
15:08:03 <bcoca> ok, going to shelve till we can discuss more with rest of galaxy team, i'll give kustodian a ping that we are discussing it as it might impact other plans
15:08:23 * bcoca hates wasting willing 'free' developer time

15:10:45 <gundalow> :(
15:11:02 <gundalow> bcoca: Can I have a #chair ?

15:11:36 * ryansb waves
15:11:39 <gundalow> #info https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44903
15:12:08 <gundalow> Currently https://github.com/ansible/ansible/labels?q=support isn't accurate, lots of things are marked incorrectly
15:12:28 <bcoca> ^ my only comment, defaulting to community for many of those dirs makes future maintenance easier imo, otherwise core will support any new plugins/module_utils by default
15:12:55 <sivel> yeah, I think defaulting to community is a good idea
15:13:03 <gundalow> Sure, I can do that and explicitly add support: core
15:13:24 <gundalow> I think that makes sense for `module_utils`
15:13:36 <gundalow> Not sure about the other `plugin/` directories
15:14:50 <bcoca> modules/module_utils have the most traffic, but  users do add to other plugins also, lots less, but it does happen
15:15:26 <gundalow> `lib/ansible/modules/` is generally driven by `ANSIBLE_METADATA`, so that should allbe community
15:15:28 <sivel> many lookups are community
15:15:32 <maxamillion> +1 to default to community
15:15:49 <bcoca> callbacks also
15:15:53 <ryansb> yeah, pretty much the sensible way to go
15:15:55 <ryansb> +1
15:16:10 <bcoca> vars_plugins has 1 , but once i create a couple more i also expect community to start contributing more
15:16:40 <gundalow> I'm not bothered about this being 100% right, just want to improve it a lot for high traffic areas of the codebase
15:16:49 <gundalow> a) I'll change module_utils to be community by default
15:17:04 <bcoca> agreed, im just saying it might save us work in future to default to community
15:17:08 <gundalow> b) looks to be community by default - which looks are supported by core?
15:17:22 <bcoca> callbacks also, most are community
15:17:25 <gundalow> s/looks/lookups/g
15:17:28 <bcoca> we probalby have to go through list
15:18:13 <sivel> we don't have much of those documented as to what are core, but most of us can point them out as needed
15:18:51 <bcoca> callbacks default/minimal/tree would be only ones core , top of my head
15:18:53 <gundalow> OK, I might just fix the support:network stuff in that PR and do a follow up PR. Need to get those labels fixed before Network can do backlog review
15:19:02 <gundalow> I'll do googlesheet for others
15:19:03 <gundalow> Thanks
15:19:22 <bcoca> maybe profile_X
15:19:32 <bcoca> and junit, cause ansible-test uses is
15:19:32 <gundalow> ?
15:19:39 <bcoca> profile_roles/profile_task callbacks
15:19:44 <gundalow> ah
15:19:53 <bcoca> an, oneline, used by -o in ansible
15:20:15 <gundalow> bcoca: ack, will do this in Google docs at somepoint in $future
15:20:19 <gundalow> as I'm out a bit next week
15:20:34 <bcoca> k, was thinking of just doing it in PR
15:23:33 <bcoca> TIL we have a 'null' callback
15:23:44 <gundalow> fair point, I'll see where I get to
15:23:45 <bcoca> anything else?
15:23:49 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
15:25:15 <Pilou> gundalow: not sure that BOTMETA "support" key is propagated to subpaths
15:25:19 * ryansb nothing going on
15:25:39 <bcoca> closing in 1 min if no other items
