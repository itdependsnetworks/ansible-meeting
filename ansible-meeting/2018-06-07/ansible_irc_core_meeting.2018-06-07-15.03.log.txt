15:14:25 * nirik wonders if should bring up the 2.5.4 test failures
15:14:49 <bcoca> /kickban nir ... er please do
15:15:01 <bcoca> tests failing in epel?
15:15:15 <bcoca> link?
15:15:29 <nirik> failing in fedora...
15:15:38 * nirik gets link
15:16:04 * jtanner wonders how fedora's tests differ from ours
15:16:30 <nirik> https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/4094/27334094/build.log
15:16:41 <nirik> they do not, it's running ansibles tests.
15:17:04 <bcoca> weird, we test on 24/25 on every commit
15:17:14 <nirik> E           AttributeError: 'Connection' object has no attribute '_winrm_kwargs'
15:17:38 <bcoca> ah, think those got fixed, @jborean93 ?
15:18:09 <nirik> so perhaps it's just something that didn't get in 2.5.4?
15:18:29 <jtanner> a bit early for jborean. nitzmahone can you look at it?
15:19:03 <abadger1999> Hmm... jborean was looking at it.
15:19:19 <abadger1999> But last I heard, he was still looking at how to fix it.
15:19:28 <nitzmahone> Yeah, the fix went in right after 2.5.4, so 2.5.5 will have it next week
15:19:28 <bcoca> yep, looks like same issue
15:19:31 * nirik admits he hasn't had time to bug people really on it. ;(
15:19:37 <abadger1999> k
15:19:54 <nirik> cool.
15:19:59 <bcoca> `ansible.errors.AnsibleError: Requested option _extras was not defined in configuration`
15:20:05 <nitzmahone> Was just some changes to the tests to switch out the patching scheme
15:20:32 <bcoca> did we ever figure out why the tests passed tests when testing the test PR?
15:25:32 <bcoca> ok, seems like nothing else to discuss
