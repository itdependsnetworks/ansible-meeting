17:12:41 <mattclay> #topic Open Floor
17:12:52 <mattclay> No announcements today. Does anyone have anything to discuss?
17:20:00 <mikedlr> Hi. I started a doc about unit testing modules.
17:20:14 <mikedlr> Anyone interested in helping?
17:20:18 <mattclay> #chair mikedlr
17:20:18 <zodbot> Current chairs: mattclay mikedlr
17:21:37 <mikedlr> Will likely share in a week or two. Mostly want good examples.
17:22:48 <mattclay> mikedlr: Low attendance today. I think it's just you and me here.
17:22:56 <sivel> I just stopped in
17:22:58 <MichaelBaydoun> I'm here
17:24:25 <mattclay> #chair sivel MichaelBaydoun
17:24:25 <zodbot> Current chairs: MichaelBaydoun mattclay mikedlr sivel
17:24:28 * mattclay waves
17:25:39 <sivel> I probably won't have much time for the next 2 months to do much of anything
17:26:20 <mikedlr> So anyone have any module unit tests already existing they are happy with / do something useful they wish others would do?
17:47:06 * mikedlr decides to use his own unit tests as examples and ignore everyone else's ..  *sulks*
17:49:20 <mattclay> Does anyone else have anything?
17:57:53 <sivel> I do not
17:59:09 <resmo> yes
17:59:13 <resmo> hi btw
17:59:28 <sivel> with 47 seconds left ;)
18:00:38 <resmo> just a silly question, would it make sense to make a "dummy" api docker service for a propriatry api to be able
18:00:48 <resmo> test it by shippable?
18:00:57 <resmo> e.g. vault cloud api?
18:01:38 <resmo> dummy api service, like capture the response of the api and make kind of e test env?
18:02:01 <mattclay> We already have a simulator for testing vmware modules.
18:02:34 <resmo> mattclay: and this is nothing "official"?
18:02:43 <mattclay> We're at the end of our scheduled meeting time. I can't stick around longer right now. Can we continue this discussion in devel later?
18:02:56 <resmo> sure
18:03:01 <mattclay> Thanks.
18:03:08 <resmo> thank you :)
18:03:14 <mattclay> If anyone has anything else, please add it to the agenda for next week.
18:03:17 <mattclay> Thanks for coming.
