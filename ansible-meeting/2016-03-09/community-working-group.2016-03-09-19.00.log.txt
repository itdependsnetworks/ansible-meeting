19:08:49 <rbergeron> okay, so i sorted out the pieces form the logs from last week
19:08:53 <rbergeron> with the things to update specifically
19:09:09 <rbergeron> since we poorly documented actions with action for robyn to update with the things above
19:09:15 <rbergeron> and ... yay meetings and day off. so
19:09:17 <rbergeron> #info an artifact that is the proposal == the proposal file, submitted as a PR and immediately merged
19:09:27 <rbergeron> #info a way of tracking discussions of that artifact == a single issue, referenced in the proposal file
19:09:36 <rbergeron> #info a way of modifying the artifact == PRs to that file, merged or not at submitter's discretion and discussed in the issue
19:09:48 <rbergeron> #info a way of putting the artifact into buckets == maybe issue tags?
19:10:00 <rbergeron> #info a time/place to discuss == weekly proposal meeting.
19:10:03 <rbergeron> And that's it.
19:10:15 <chouse> so is there a new proposal repo, yet?
19:10:21 <rbergeron> Along with the previous items of
19:10:24 <rbergeron> #info create the new ansible/proposals repo
19:10:33 <rbergeron> #info relocate current proposals into new repo
19:11:08 <rbergeron> note: for future reference, when we give actions in an irc meeting, we should prepend the actual action with the nick of the person assigned to that
19:11:25 <rbergeron> because nobody's name is ttached to create the repo / reloate the repo
19:11:31 <rbergeron> relocate the repo
19:11:35 <rbergeron> is that me? or someone else?
19:11:53 <gregdek> It's you :)

19:54:32 <vincent_vdk> no big community questions gregdek :)
19:54:59 <gregdek> chouse: just the CFP date.
