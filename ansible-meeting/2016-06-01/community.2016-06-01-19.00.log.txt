19:01:06 <gregdek> #topic Roll Call
19:01:16 <gregdek> rbergeron can't make it today because of a prior commitment
19:02:56 * gundalow waves
19:03:01 * ttom here
19:03:41 <resmo> hi
19:04:52 <gregdek> Hi ho!
19:04:54 <gregdek> OK:
19:05:16 <gregdek> Agenda, as always:
19:05:17 <gregdek> https://waffle.io/ansible/community
19:05:40 <gregdek> The big one today is #81
19:05:59 <gregdek> #topic Module Maintainer Guidelines
19:06:00 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/81
19:06:16 <gregdek> First cut is here:
19:06:17 <gregdek> https://github.com/robynbergeron/thingsandstuff/blob/master/MODULEMAINTAINERS.md
19:07:00 <gregdek> Which looks like a good first pass.
19:07:11 <gregdek> Missing some details, but a good starting point.
19:07:45 <jtanner> "reasonably timely manner." ... should be a little more specific
19:08:00 <jtanner> not precisely an SLA, but some type of unit
19:08:43 <gregdek> We'll get there.
19:08:55 <gregdek> Probably goes to the "orphaning" process.
19:09:00 <jtanner> and closure policy/guidelines
19:09:12 <gregdek> "Don't respond in X time and your module goes into the "unmaintained" pile."
19:09:34 <jtanner> although i guess maintainers can't close other peoples tickets
19:09:42 <jtanner> yet
19:09:56 <gregdek> No, but they will be able to use the "closeme" flag at some point, and the bot will close the issue.
19:10:04 <gregdek> Yet to be implemented :)
19:11:18 <gregdek> So I'll work with rbergeron to hammer out a second draft.
19:12:21 <resmo> IMHO we have close_me for PRs
19:12:29 <gregdek> resmo: oh, do we?
19:12:42 <resmo> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/blob/master/triage.py#L511
19:12:51 <gregdek> LOL
19:13:03 <gregdek> So we did! I forgot I merged it!
19:13:11 <gregdek> I stand corrected.
19:13:11 <resmo> :)
19:14:04 <MichaelBaydoun> gregdek: I do that all the time
19:14:24 <gregdek> Me too. That's why I write things down, and still forget them, LOL
19:14:25 <gregdek> Anyway.
19:14:44 <gregdek> That was the big thing. Other stuff is "no progress" due to PTO and long weekend and such.
19:14:58 <gregdek> #topic Open Floor
19:19:02 <gregdek> :)
19:19:07 * gregdek will wait a few
