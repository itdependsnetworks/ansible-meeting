19:05:00 <oolongbrothers> About the PRs: We have gotten help by dagwieers, but have not gotten much attention otherwise. Is it in good shape? I know that intagration tests are missing, which is not great and I am working on.
19:05:37 <bcoca> seems like tests would have to rely on external repos ... im fine w/o them
19:05:48 <bcoca> so 2 modules, 1 for package management the other for repos?
19:05:55 <oolongbrothers> Yes
19:06:03 <bcoca> just needs a nother set of eyes? dag is normally a good reviewer
19:06:54 <bcoca> any volunteers?
19:07:10 <maxamillion> I'll take it
19:07:14 <bcoca> thnx
19:07:20 <oolongbrothers> That's great, thanks.
19:07:57 <bcoca> quick skim shows it as 'mergable' to me, but i would like at least 1 more in depth, maxamillion merge em if you like what you see
19:08:09 <maxamillion> bcoca: will do, thanks
19:08:43 <bcoca> #topic open floor
19:09:22 <oolongbrothers> Looking forward to your feedback, maxamillion.
19:09:59 <maxamillion> oolongbrothers: +1 - I'll try to get to it by the end of the day
19:10:34 <oolongbrothers> That would be exquisite :)
19:11:00 <bcoca> so if no new business i'll close in 2mins
19:12:30 <maxamillion> +1
