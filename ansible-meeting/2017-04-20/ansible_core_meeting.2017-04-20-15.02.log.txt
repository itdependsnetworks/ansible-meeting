15:03:21 <trishnag> Hi
15:03:30 <shertel> hello
15:03:56 <gundalow> #info Agenda https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/159
15:04:55 <nitzmahone> Boop
15:06:16 <gundalow> Just been looking at the minutes from Tuesday, I don't see anything that's progressed
15:06:19 <gundalow> so
15:06:20 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
15:06:48 <gundalow> Anyone got anything?
15:06:58 <gundalow> If not I have some questions for London Contributor Fest
15:07:49 <kennc> I have something
15:08:07 <nitzmahone> The last agenda item (meeting frequency)
15:08:23 <itdependsnetwork> updated nickname :)
15:08:24 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: what's your topic
15:08:28 <gundalow> +1
15:08:34 <gundalow> one line summary so I can set the topic
15:08:36 <gundalow> please
15:08:51 <itdependsnetwork> What is Ansible's recommended method of distributing custom modules?
15:09:02 <gundalow> #topic Ansible's recommended method of distributing custom modules?
15:09:09 <itdependsnetwork> In regards to Issue #20702 and subsequent PR #20717. Just trying to get an understanding of Ansible's recommended method of distributing custom modules? The last I heard, that though this was only introduced in 2.1, it would be 5 revisions (including 2.3) until it is fixed.
15:09:43 <gundalow> ah, this is Module namespace conflicts "setup.py" in particula
15:09:51 <gundalow> r
15:10:18 <itdependsnetwork> correct, so the best I know is pip is out of the question
15:10:52 <gundalow> bcoca's comment of https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/20702#issuecomment-276518779 is a good summary
15:10:55 <itdependsnetwork> Difficult to easily let users ensure requirements are met whithout it
15:11:48 * gundalow differs to people that know Python better
15:12:56 <gundalow> So I'll hold my hand up and say I'm not sure how/why people hit thsi
15:13:01 <gundalow> this*
15:13:29 <bcoca> ansible-pkgmgr
15:13:30 <gundalow> Are people creating modules called "setup"
15:13:38 <itdependsnetwork> I know why, and a fix is in, it's just going to be years until it is fully implemented (the best I understand it)
15:13:50 <bcoca> gundalow: no, setup issue is cause that is what setup_tools uses for install script
15:14:00 <gundalow> ah because https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-ansible/blob/master/setup.py exists
15:14:14 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20717
15:14:16 <gundalow> which is what pip/setuptools? use
15:14:34 <bcoca> people do override setup (to make custom fact gathering) but it is very rare
15:14:37 <itdependsnetwork> correct, I do not believe there is an alternate
15:14:41 <bcoca> ^ main issue is sovled by PR above
15:15:15 <bcoca> but still does not fix 'module/plugin' distribution as pip is insufficient
15:15:23 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: stupid question, can this be fixed by changing where/what ntc-ansible dumps itself so setup.py isn't under library?
15:15:31 <itdependsnetwork> @bcoca: agreed, but I remember someone saying it would be 5 releases until it is actually fixed
15:15:41 <bcoca> gundalow: no, cause ansiballz requires this
15:15:54 <bcoca> itdependsnetwork: if all goes well ....
15:16:03 <bcoca> right now 'roles' are only way to distribute plugins/modules
15:16:13 <itdependsnetwork> but not requirements
15:16:15 <gundalow> cd ~/src/ansible-modules
15:16:20 <gundalow> git clone https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-ansible --recursive
15:16:34 <bcoca> itdependsnetwork: depends on how you write the role ...
15:16:46 <itdependsnetwork> fair enough
15:16:58 <bcoca> ^ i think i just figured out how to do ansible-pkgmgr w/o actually writing it .....
15:17:09 <itdependsnetwork> should not speak in superlatives
15:17:10 <bcoca> roles as packages that execute themselves to install ...
15:17:18 <itdependsnetwork> I was not aware of a way
15:17:47 * bcoca is on caffine withdrawl so might be rambling right now
15:18:21 <itdependsnetwork> talking about: https://github.com/mantiz/ansible-library-pkgmgr ?
15:19:49 <bcoca> nope
15:19:54 <bcoca> im not
15:20:22 <itdependsnetwork> you mind pointing me to a link?
15:20:23 <bcoca> ^ btw, package module alreayd does that
15:20:38 <bcoca> itdependsnetwork: i dont have 'link to thoughts' working yet
15:20:59 <bcoca> itdependsnetwork: ansible-pkgmgr is my 'current name' for a 'ansible plugin installer'
15:21:07 <nitzmahone> bcocabrain://ansible/module-packager
15:21:19 <itdependsnetwork> @nitzmahone: lol
15:21:19 <bcoca> ^ 403
15:21:47 <nitzmahone> 401
15:21:54 <itdependsnetwork> ok, got it. to go back to "depends on how you write the role .."
15:22:01 <itdependsnetwork> how can I write the role?
15:23:00 <bcoca> role is actually an installer
15:23:12 <bcoca> so fetch + run role, installs plugins
15:23:39 <bcoca> ^ i think i just fixed all my issues with ansible-pkgmgr
15:23:54 <itdependsnetwork> my issues as well?
15:24:08 * gundalow locks bcoca in a room (with coffee) so he can write this up
15:25:52 <bcoca> itdependsnetwork: that is beteween you and your therapist
15:26:00 <itdependsnetwork> lol
15:26:19 <bcoca> but yes, it should .. and much sooner than 5 releases
15:26:30 <alikins> for that ntc-ansible case, my suggestion would be to just add /path/to/ansible-ntc-repo/library/ to ansible module path
15:27:54 <itdependsnetwork> still have an issue there :) there is a submodule that also has setup.py in it
15:28:42 <gundalow> rm setup.py
15:29:36 <gundalow> back in a minute, just grabbing a drink
15:29:45 <bcoca> make mine a scotch!
15:31:01 <itdependsnetwork> don't want to derail further, I know how to fix the issue on an individual basis. Just not very easy to let users know.
15:31:06 <gundalow> back
15:31:13 <gundalow> bcoca: once you write it up
15:31:30 <itdependsnetwork> If ansible-pkgmgr is the answer, that is fine
15:32:00 <gundalow> #action bcoca to write up his new idea roles as plugin installers (not installing and referencing role, but fetching and running role and have role itself install plugins and deps). means ansible-pkgmgr does almost nothing (fetch role which galaxy already does) + run it leave all logic up to role
15:32:06 <gundalow> #info rm setup.py?
15:32:12 <itdependsnetwork> Just trying to communicate the issues seeing on my end (and a bunch of other's as I see in a issue search) and find out the recommended way
15:32:23 <gundalow> #info for that ntc-ansible case, my suggestion would be to just add /path/to/ansible-ntc-repo/library/ to ansible module path
15:32:31 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: It's a good question
15:32:36 <bcoca> itdependsnetwork: if/when i merge the gather_facts rename, that issue should go away
15:32:57 <itdependsnetwork> but I thought someone indicated 5 releases?
15:33:01 <itdependsnetwork> is that not the case?
15:33:07 <gundalow> 5 releases = 2.5 years?
15:34:00 <bcoca> itdependsnetwork: that was me thinking of when i could have a good enough package  manager created
15:34:41 <itdependsnetwork> from Mar 9: "or anyone can you confirm that the issue of name space over "setup.*" will exist for the next 4 versions? referring to -> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20717"
15:34:43 <agaffney> creating another package manager is rarely the answer to any problem
15:34:52 <itdependsnetwork> "<@bcoca> probalby 5 as that is not getting merged for 2.3"
15:35:11 <gundalow> agaffney: +1
15:36:26 <bcoca> agaffney++10
15:36:30 <gundalow> Anything else on this topic?
15:36:36 <itdependsnetwork> good for me
15:36:41 <gundalow> cool
15:36:43 <agaffney> bcoca: invalid syntax
15:37:09 <gundalow> #topic AnsibleFest Contributors Summit
15:37:52 <gundalow> #info There will be an all day Contributors Summit the day before London AnsibleFest, people can attend in person or remotely for all/part
15:38:04 <gundalow> #info If you think you can make it in person please ping me directly
15:38:27 <gundalow> #info we will soon be asking for topics for the agenda, so have a think
15:40:06 <gundalow> Likewise if you have any ideas feel free to let me know
15:40:53 <gundalow> #info Previous Contributor Summit agendas & minutes can be found at https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/MEETINGS.md#past-in-person-meetings
15:41:03 <gundalow> Anyone got anything to add on that?
15:42:00 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
15:42:06 <gundalow> Anything else?
15:42:23 <bcoca> meeting calendar
15:42:45 <gundalow> #topic IRC Meetings
15:43:03 <bcoca> seems these meetings have less and less attendance, i move we go to weekly instaead of biweekly
15:43:04 <gundalow> #info Does this schedule work for people, do we need to change it?
15:43:27 <bcoca> ^ with rotating 'time zone' friendly schedule
15:43:54 <gundalow> The Tue & Thursday core meetings seem fairly close, maybe they should be pushed earlier/later in the day
15:44:17 <gundalow> maybe some sort of (doodle) poll to see what people think
15:44:59 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: agaffney Are the two non-core people here, what do you think?
15:45:29 <itdependsnetwork> I'm not on too much, but makes sense to me :)
15:47:03 <agaffney> the schedule of the core meetings work for me, but I don't always attend. I only show up if I have something in particular to talk about or am bored and see a meeting is going on
15:48:22 <gundalow> agaffney: So you look at the GitHub emails regarding what people add to the issue?
15:48:52 <agaffney> nope, it's usually when it's something that I've proposed or just saw talk about in #-dev
15:49:00 <gundalow> ACK
15:49:44 <agaffney> today is a "I was bored and saw there was a meeting going on" day
15:51:35 <gundalow> :)
15:54:04 <gundalow> #info Need to create a poll and ask the community, needs more thought
15:55:24 <gundalow> Guess we are done
16:00:17 <gundalow> Thanks everyone!
