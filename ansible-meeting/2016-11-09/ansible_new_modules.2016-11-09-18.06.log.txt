18:06:52 <ryansb> hi
18:06:53 <gundalow> #topic AWS ELB modules
18:06:58 <gundalow> shaharmor: Hi :)
18:07:01 <shaharmor> Hi
18:07:07 <gundalow> #info https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/92#issuecomment-259465655
18:07:23 <shaharmor> As i wrote in the Issue, there are new modules that require some attention
18:07:52 <shaharmor> I have fixed many bugs locally but wasn't sure if I should wait for the existing PRs maintainers to handle it or create a new one
18:08:28 <shaharmor> Because I haven't seem any update on their side for a few days now
18:09:13 <gundalow> "a few days" isn't that long a time for this stuff. People are often doing this in the evenings along side their day jobs
18:09:20 <ryansb> shaharmor: it's much easier for us to review when the full new module is in one PR (I see you've got two outstanding w/ the original contributor)
18:09:31 <ryansb> is wimnat here?
18:09:58 <shaharmor> The original contributor is wimnat, then there are some fixes from naslanidis, and also some fixes from me
18:10:07 * resmo waves
18:11:07 <jtanner> hi
18:11:50 <shaharmor> ryansb: I understand that, so should I open a new PR with all the fixes merged together?
18:13:03 <ryansb> I think so. Definitely retain authorship w/ wimnat, since they wrote a lot of it based on looking at the PRs
18:13:30 <shaharmor> Yup
18:13:45 <shaharmor> Ok I'll do that and come back here next week with the updates :)
18:13:50 <ryansb> Also, minor thing: the second module is "elb_target_group", but since that is specific to App load balancer, I think it would make more sense to call it "alb_target_group"
18:14:04 <shaharmor> Regarding that
18:14:07 <ryansb> shaharmor: also @ me (also ryansb on github) when you open that so I can help review
18:14:27 <shaharmor> I think that since in AWS it appears under ec2, it should start with ec2_
18:14:41 <shaharmor> so something like ec2_alb & ec2_target_group
18:14:58 <shaharmor> I don't think that the target group is specifically under alb
18:15:26 <shaharmor> ryansb: will do
18:15:33 <ryansb> So that's a bit of a point of contention, since many AWS services don't fall under ec2 (like, an "ec2_kinesis" module would be odd)
18:16:03 <ryansb> maybe prefixing with aws_ would be good practice, but honestly we've been bad about that thus far (for example, cloudformation and cloudformation_facts)
18:16:04 <shaharmor> But kinesis doesn't appear under ec2
18:16:22 <ryansb> Target groups are under ECS I thought
18:16:26 <shaharmor> No
18:16:40 <ryansb> I have to research the new ALB more before I review, obviously
18:16:59 <shaharmor> http://imgur.com/a/ZyRDJ
18:17:14 <shaharmor> this is the sidebar of AWS when you're viewing the ec2 section
18:17:46 <shaharmor> It might appear under ECS as well
18:17:51 <shaharmor> I didn't check
18:18:56 <shaharmor> Anyway the name is not the main part here, we can decide about it later
18:19:07 <ryansb> So yeah, ec2_alb (or ec2_application_load_balancer) and ec2_alb_target_group work for me
18:19:25 <ryansb> yeah, so the main bit is: consolidate PRs, and then we can get a proper review on
18:19:35 <shaharmor> Ok thanks
18:20:09 <shaharmor> Have a good evening
18:26:00 <ryansb> any other modules?
