17:04:36 <gundalow> I've already seen it report issues against new PRs, so yay
17:05:14 <gundalow> sivel: over to you
17:05:45 <sivel> It seems to be working reliably.  the aci modules are getting a bunch of clean up right now
17:06:12 <sivel> the only thing to account for is PRs that were submitted before that merge, and that haven't gone to stale_ci yet
17:06:36 <gundalow> Nod, we hit issues like that everytime we raise the bar

17:17:51 <gundalow> Pilou: How's things?
17:19:56 <Pilou> I hope skip.txt for import test will be empty soon :)
17:25:07 <Pilou> it seems other ansible-* command should be tested in "ansible" integration targets
17:39:38 <gundalow> Pilou: yup
