19:01:54 <gregdek> #topic Roll Call
19:02:05 <gregdek> We'll wait a couple mins for folks to say hi and then jump into the agenda
19:02:35 <rbergeron> hi :)
19:03:48 <gregdek> OK!
19:03:59 <gregdek> #topic Ansiblefest Brooklyn planning/recap
19:04:25 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/115
19:04:31 <gregdek> We're done with that!
19:04:42 <gregdek> But we should figure out what materials we want to make available after the fact.
19:04:53 <rbergeron> well, i have been asked to make a blog post
19:04:55 <gregdek> And also say: how did it go?
19:05:00 <rbergeron> which i said i'd do sometime this week
19:05:05 <rbergeron> while digging out of my inbox
19:05:20 <bcoca> i only remember tequila
19:05:26 <rbergeron> bcoca: me too
19:05:37 <rbergeron> i remember a few other things though. links to pages where all the memories are actually at :)
19:05:50 <gregdek> That's the key.
19:06:10 <rbergeron> yes. :)
19:06:37 <rbergeron> so yeah, I think we're done with that, and i shall haz a blog post and probably figure out how to put things on the mailing list in some way
19:06:50 <gregdek> OK, then, simple enough. rbergeron writes recap, tells the world, and then we close. I've updated accordingly.
19:08:01 <gregdek> And then we've got lots of other stuff in backlog, but mostly they're outdated workflow stuffs for a rapidly evolving project.
19:08:23 <gregdek> I think we're about to Evolve, and we're gonna end up with a whole new set of stuff. :)
19:09:03 <gregdek> The repo unification meeting this Thursday is The Big One.
19:09:05 <rbergeron> I will not make a pokemon joke
19:09:17 <gregdek> Why? That was the whole point of the setup!
19:09:31 <gregdek> ansibull -> ???
19:10:07 <gregdek> Anyhoo.
19:10:08 <jtanner> ansibull... ansibull ... ansibullbot HO!
19:10:09 <jtanner> ?
19:10:18 <gregdek> :)
19:10:45 <gregdek> #info Repo unification meeting on Thursday 1300 Eastern US time
19:10:46 <jtanner> i'm will do an overhaul of ansibullbot for the repomerge
19:10:47 <rbergeron> because i'm curmudgeonly
19:10:48 <rbergeron> :)
19:10:58 <jtanner> just need the meeting to happen so i can get expectations
19:11:14 <bcoca> expect pain
19:11:19 <gregdek> Yep. jtanner is taking all that over, which obsoletes much of what we've worked on -- we'll become more advisory.
19:11:19 <jtanner> of course
19:11:23 <gregdek> There will, of course, be pain. :)
19:11:57 <rbergeron> fortunately, we are all masochists, so that's fiiiiiiine
19:12:03 <rbergeron> :)

19:13:35 <gregdek> (whoops afk one sec)
