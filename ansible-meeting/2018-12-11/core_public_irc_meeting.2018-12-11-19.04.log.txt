19:05:08 <sdoran> o/
19:05:15 <Pilou> o/
19:05:24 <nitzmahone> yo
19:05:58 <bcoca> wanted more eyes on async revamp before doing rebuild_merge
19:06:09 <bcoca> anyone see any red flags on that pr?
19:06:40 <sdoran> I'm not familiar enough with how async works to comment.
19:06:48 <sdoran> Always something to learn. :)
19:07:26 <nitzmahone> +1; I screwed around with that a lot early on and always hated the sleep... This is a lot more like the way the Windows one works now
19:08:49 <bcoca> yeah, my concern was the 'non friendly to ipc' kids  ... but tested those and it seems to work fine
19:08:52 <nitzmahone> Now we just need to fix POSIX async to work with pipelining ;)
19:09:05 <bcoca> #youcandream
19:09:14 <nitzmahone> Hey it works great on Windows :)
19:09:37 <bcoca> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20078
19:10:34 <bcoca> i really dont think roles should be picking files from outside the role, it kind of breaks expectations
19:11:13 <bcoca> i might be convinced of subdirs .. but if you have that many files to choose inside a role, i think your role is way too big
19:11:22 <sdoran> Oh yeah, that's crossing the streams hardcore.
19:11:38 <abadger1999> I don't think this one is right
19:11:39 <sdoran> That creates really nasty interdependencies.
19:11:46 <nitzmahone> Yeah, I could see reasons for subdirs, but outside the roles is ... yikes
19:12:37 <sdoran> I'm not sure that PR directly addresses the linked issue.
19:13:01 <sdoran> I like the idea of accepting subdirs for tasks_from relative to the role dir.
19:13:26 <bcoca> well, it does, but by overkill and allowing all dirs
19:13:29 <nitzmahone> Yeah, the approach is incorrect
19:13:33 <sdoran> Ok.
19:13:55 <abadger1999> I think I would be okay with subdirs.
19:13:59 <bcoca> i would even say subdirs seems too much, but that would be minimal i would need to consider this
19:14:38 <nitzmahone> Seems like we're pretty well "-1 in current form, subdirs-only might be a point for discussion later"
19:15:06 <sdoran> I'm ok with subdirs in a role. Since we now allow arbitrary entry points to a role, allowing folks to organize things into subdirs seems helpful.
19:15:09 <bcoca> k, going to close this with note , leaving original ticket open
19:15:21 <sdoran> I agree with what @nitzmahone said.
19:15:35 <bcoca> sdoran: not totally opposed, but if you need subdirs to organize your role tasks ... i think you are doing roles wrong
19:15:52 <bcoca> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44428
19:16:04 <bcoca> ^ changes inventory plugins priority to allow 'auto' a first crack
19:16:06 <sdoran> touch√©
19:16:52 <nitzmahone> Since no valid yaml or ini inventory should be readable by auto, I don't see a problem with this
19:17:36 <bcoca> +1 from me also
19:18:11 <bcoca> static inventories should be the last ones tried, since they can 'gulp' a lot 'partially valid' files
19:19:01 <bcoca> if no one against, i'll do rebuild_merge on it
19:19:05 <sdoran> +1
19:19:10 <sdoran> Does it need a changelog entry?
19:19:15 <abadger1999> yes
19:19:22 <bcoca> #topic create ansible/ansible-baseline
19:19:28 <abadger1999> Probably also porting guide entry
19:19:45 <sdoran> Pilou: Can you add those items to the PR please?
19:20:07 <Pilou> the changelog entry ? yes
19:20:13 <nitzmahone> @abadger1999 really? (on the porting guide entry) - shouldn't be any user-visible changes beyond a different order of noise in a failure case
19:20:15 <Pilou> and porting guide too :)
19:20:19 <bcoca> porting guide should be 0
19:20:27 <bcoca> maybe a note?
19:20:41 <bcoca> hey, order changed, you should just see less noise
19:20:44 <sdoran> Just a note since it may result in a change in behavior.
19:20:48 <sdoran> Yes, less noise. :)
19:21:00 <abadger1999> Will it lways be less noise or can it be more?
19:21:00 <sdoran> Because unfortunately very few people read the changelogs.
19:21:15 <nitzmahone> I think worst case it would be the same noise in a different order
19:21:23 <nitzmahone> (and only then when nothing succeeded)
19:21:26 <bcoca> i can only see more if auto plugin is broken
19:22:04 <bcoca> #topic create ansible/ansible-baseline
19:22:09 <bcoca> #topic create ansible/ansible-baseline
19:22:16 <nitzmahone> You should only see noise at all on failure or if you have extra verbosity; in the extra verbosity case, you'd see less noise in success cases
19:23:16 <bcoca> sivel: were'nt you creating baseline already?
19:23:39 <bcoca> gundalow: you seem to have a item to move it to 'public sphere'
19:23:41 <sivel> Yes, that exists under my name right now
19:23:55 <bcoca> ah, Pilou unsure what the ask is then
19:24:12 <bcoca> just the move to ansible/ ?
19:24:15 <Pilou> yes
19:24:26 <bcoca> @gundalow  i believe is working on that
19:24:27 <sivel> I'll be working to get it under our org soon
19:24:34 <bcoca> k, so 'in progress'
19:24:39 <sivel> We need to more strictly define what it is first
19:24:48 <sivel> because once it is "ready" it can never be modified again
19:24:59 <gundalow> bcoca: I think sivel needs to in do the he remove move. Once moved I can do the community bit
19:25:03 <sivel> only to address changes in features
19:25:08 <bcoca> we can have a meeting about that .. but i'm going to close the topic then
19:25:19 <sivel> yeah, it's still in my court right now
19:25:21 <bcoca> #topic https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/46561
19:25:37 <bcoca> ericzolf ?
19:26:15 <abadger1999> Hmm.. different reason this should be porting guided... it will require people with an ansible.cfg to manually change the config setting to match our recommendations.
19:26:16 <bcoca> -1 from me, i would create role with 3 tasks that does same (2 find, 1 assert)
19:26:55 <bcoca> abadger1999: only if they deviated from defaults ... but we all seem fine with adding note already
19:27:21 <bcoca> ^ deviation being why you wrote entry in .cfg
19:28:38 <bcoca> eric not here, anyone want to advocate for this or should i postpone?
19:29:09 <nitzmahone> punt
19:29:14 <bcoca> ed
19:29:19 <bcoca> #topic open floor
19:29:45 <bcoca> @sivel basline being 'immutable' might not be best , we might want to make EACH entry immutable, but not the whole repo
19:30:22 <abadger1999> I'm not sure if I'd allow that in in some way... but I think the current interface is too complex for us to want it as it.
19:30:23 <bcoca> we might come up with diff tests later on, loads can vary a lot
19:31:06 <abadger1999> (that == 46561)
19:32:10 <sivel> bcoca: we can discuss it in more detail later, but further than just our own perf baselining, this will be used by support too.  Initial discussions mentioned that the project would be immutable once we decided it was golden
19:32:45 <bcoca> i see why you want that, i doubt that is achievable considering 'cases' will crop up
19:32:55 <bcoca> but ok, to discuss later
19:32:56 <Pilou> sivel: about baseline, have you been contacted by dw ? it seems he was willing to contribute ?
19:35:00 <bcoca> k, since nothing new, ending the meeting
