19:17:44 <gregdek> #51: Weekly new module report to ansible-devel
19:18:13 <gregdek> This is now as automated as it's going to be. Will be sent every Tuesday. I'll add some more messaging about the new-modules meeting.
19:18:22 <gregdek> Will finish it up and close in the next day or two.
19:18:34 <gundalow> \o/
19:18:43 <gregdek> #36: Document / implement issue triage process
19:18:43 <rbergeron> yay reports
19:18:50 <gregdek> rbergeron: how goes?
19:19:42 <rbergeron> hey, i'm slacking on this (mostly because we chatted on it a bit again monday and i havent had a block of time)
19:19:45 <rbergeron> but
19:19:45 <rbergeron> yea.
19:19:57 <rbergeron> i think the "whack all the bs and get people to talk" is better.
19:20:14 <rbergeron> though -- looking at thtat in concert with anything around the new module pr process ...
19:20:21 <rbergeron> well,, i won't ... get all myopic
19:20:23 <rbergeron> or whatever
19:20:41 <gregdek> new module pr process -- let's isolate that damage :)
19:21:01 <rbergeron> yeah
19:21:12 <rbergeron> i agree ;) lol
19:21:44 <rbergeron> well - i have time (i think?) after this meeting before the next one to poke and ... yeah
19:22:12 <rbergeron> oh i lied. after that meeting though. :)
19:23:32 <rbergeron> gregdek: you alive? :)
19:23:45 <gregdek> OK. So we're going to implement next week. We're ready for that, right? :)
19:24:00 <gregdek> Ready to slam the door on this one.
19:24:09 <rbergeron> yeah.
19:24:19 <rbergeron> and i guess it will likely be way easier to implement, so :)
19:24:53 <gregdek> Yes. :)
19:25:00 <gregdek> OK, next:
19:25:54 <gregdek> #47: travis performance
19:26:00 <gregdek> Nothing new from gundalow correct?
19:26:20 <gundalow> gregdek: correct
19:26:25 <gregdek> Thx!
19:26:28 <gregdek> Moving on:
19:26:36 <gregdek> #23 docs/proposals
19:26:55 <gregdek> Last piece is getting this scheduled as a regular part of the core meeting, and I believe we've accomplished that.
19:27:03 <gregdek> So I think this one is done!
19:27:11 <rbergeron> i think we need to write it down soemwhere.
19:27:18 <rbergeron> like, that this is a thing, in docs.
19:27:37 <rbergeron> which ithink was on my list to do and ... yay all the other things going on
19:27:40 <gregdek> See https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/MEETINGS.md
19:28:13 <gregdek> I think it's time to close this issue, though. It's now a thing that we discuss.
19:28:26 <gregdek> For driving more attention to it, I think we can open another issue. Let's take credit for this one. :)
19:28:39 <rbergeron> kk
19:29:06 <gundalow> :D
19:29:29 <gregdek> Next:
19:29:38 <gregdek> #45: Clarify PR labels and process
19:30:08 <rbergeron> so -- i think i linked to my start to that in there, yes?
19:30:13 * rbergeron looks
19:31:15 <rbergeron> yeah, a wee start on the definitions. I guess i'm still on the hook for the pretty map picture of the Pr process itself.
19:31:33 <gregdek> If you think it necessary.
19:32:01 <rbergeron> well -- we have a picture, i suspect you know better than i if it's even still loosely applicable or if it needs major plumbing done :)
19:32:31 <rbergeron> mostly i'm not sure if you guys are "done done" or or still ... fine tuning
19:32:38 <rbergeron> other than corner case weird bugginess with the bot
19:33:07 <gregdek> We're never going to be "done done". That's part of the issue.
19:33:16 <rbergeron> so:
19:33:38 <rbergeron> I think part of this (making the map) was so we could figure out how to make the bot work.
19:33:51 <rbergeron> if the bot is working more or less, i think the picture is ... less needed.
19:34:01 <rbergeron> having the "what the labels mean" be documented is useful though, i think
19:34:20 <rbergeron> just because people looking who aren't necessarily involved in the process want to be able to ascertain soem sort of state / info quickly
19:34:38 <rbergeron> yes/no?
19:34:41 <gregdek> I think I agree witht hat.
19:34:43 <gregdek> that.
19:34:45 <gregdek> that hat.
19:35:17 <gregdek> Perhaps we ditch the diagram and rebuild the process flow around this label list and see how that feels.
19:35:37 <gregdek> Some of the bot improvements have helped, because now the logic is clearer in many cases.
19:36:15 <gregdek> If you can offer this list as a PR, I can clean it up.
19:36:23 <gregdek> Where should it live, though?
19:36:54 <rbergeron> hmmm.
19:37:27 <rbergeron> well - keeping it close to ansibullbot seems wise, linking to it from whereever it might be needed (community contribution docs, etc) seems logical
19:37:45 <rbergeron> although -
19:37:46 <rbergeron> wait
19:37:59 <gregdek> Oh. Yeah.
19:38:05 <gregdek> That does make sense.
19:38:41 <gregdek> Wait...?
19:38:42 <rbergeron> oh, never mind. i guess i had a moment where i was thinking maybe hovering over a label gave more info or something.
19:39:02 <rbergeron> like, that the definition of what it meant could be directly attached
19:39:03 <rbergeron> but
19:39:03 <gregdek> No one would ever remember to do that, LOL
19:39:15 <rbergeron> apparently hitting the pipe too hard
19:39:16 <rbergeron> ;)
19:39:23 <rbergeron> (KIDDING BOSS KIDDING)
19:39:59 <gregdek> Ok. So add to the issue that we'll move into ansible/ansibullbot and reassign to me for edit/review?
19:41:03 <rbergeron> sure?
19:41:33 <rbergeron> noted
19:41:39 <rbergeron> done
19:42:07 <gregdek> :)
19:42:18 <gregdek> #40: Code of Conduct update
19:42:23 <gregdek> This is making me really mad btw.
19:42:35 <rbergeron> still no address?
19:42:52 <gregdek> Nope. And we're now past the "two weeks" point.
19:42:57 <gregdek> So imma go get angry.
19:43:05 <gregdek> Internal Big Company Nonsense.
19:43:11 <rbergeron> kind of surprised there isn't a self-service portal for alias-type stuff
19:43:21 <gregdek> There is. I used it. It got routed into nightmare-land.
19:43:33 <gregdek> So I'm going straight to tbarr to fix it, yesterday.
19:44:24 <rbergeron> okay!
19:45:59 <gregdek> #topic Ready Issues
19:46:16 <gregdek> Lots here. Let's scan and make sure the priority is right.
19:46:47 <gregdek> "Number of orgs in Galaxy" is high priority, so I'm moving it into Ready. :)
19:47:17 <gregdek> ANything else critical from your perspective?
19:47:23 <rbergeron> okay. i know. :)
19:47:24 <rbergeron> ummm
19:48:00 <rbergeron> not really.
19:48:12 <gregdek> Do you have what you need for galaxy orgs?
19:48:42 <rbergeron> not yet, but just need to sync up with house.
19:50:27 <gregdek> yaaaay netsplit
19:50:35 <gregdek> chouse: ^^^
19:50:54 <rbergeron> it's scheduled (as of like 3 seconds ago)
19:50:55 <rbergeron> :)
19:52:20 <gregdek> W00T :)
19:52:33 <gregdek> OK, I think it's time to crank thru some stuff.
19:52:43 <gregdek> Since we've got 8m left and IRC is being cranky.
19:52:49 <gregdek> Anything else urgent from anyone?
19:53:19 <tima> Nothing urgent. Just curious how the existing proposal docs/PR get migrated in to the process that is getting closed out now.
19:53:29 <tima> process discussion that is.
19:53:32 <gundalow> Nothing else from me
19:53:38 <tima> the process is very open now. ;)
19:54:03 <gregdek> tima: it should be. :) Simplifying, the goal was (a) have a place to submit proposals, and (b) have a venue to discuss them.
19:54:20 <tima> understood and agreed.
19:54:23 <gregdek> (a) is done: submit an issue at ansible/proposals, with a supporting PR if you so choose (or not).
19:54:27 <tima> somethings slipped in there already though.
19:54:36 <gregdek> (b) is going to be part of the Ansible Core Team meetings on IRC.
19:55:04 <tima> meaning the proposals were merged as first drafts
19:55:06 <rbergeron> I think the solution for the remaining items is make sure they each have an issue that points at the PR.
19:55:10 <tima> can't comment on those
19:55:13 <gregdek> Some details to be worked out yet, but it's now perfectly valid to show up at that meeting and say "I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PROPOSAL X DAMMIT"
19:55:14 <rbergeron> so we can track them.
19:55:45 <rbergeron> i think most of them are not super contentious or anything like that so i don't think it's going to be disruptive in workflow.
19:55:49 <tima> i'm trying to show up. the times i've seen posted weren't entirely accurate.
19:55:58 <resmo> bcoca: hmm if I get you right, you are saying the bot should not change from needs_revision to needs_rebase?
19:56:09 <bcoca> resmo: yep
19:56:12 <gregdek> Oh, that is still a loose end, isn't it? We do have proposal files that don't have issues.
19:56:19 <tima> right.
19:56:26 <tima> that's what i'm asking about.
19:56:32 <gregdek> tima: latest MEETINGS.md should be correct.
19:56:46 <gregdek> I'll go set up those issues now, should take 5 mins.
19:56:49 <rbergeron> gregdek: yeah, i can go in and add those (i think that was a thing, maybe that didn't get into the issue to track it)
19:56:53 <rbergeron> or you can do that
19:57:07 <rbergeron> since i have to go to an openstack summit meeting here in 3 minutes
19:57:10 <rbergeron> and be perky
19:57:20 <rbergeron> but the meeting times should be stable
19:57:26 <resmo> bcoca: hmm but needs_revision does not necessarily means the PR needs a rebase, submitters often just add another commit
19:57:31 <rbergeron> other than a bit of confusion re: the networking meeting being today vs. starting next week
19:57:39 <tima> OK. I have to go back and look at MEETINGS.md now. I think I did over a week ago.
19:58:04 <bcoca> resmo: still, no need to rebase unless PR is revised first
19:58:06 <rbergeron> tima: it's got direct links to utc conversion now
19:58:27 <tima> woohoo. that will help. ;)
19:58:36 <rbergeron> but the times haven't changed
19:58:37 <resmo> bcoca: hmm ok, in this view, it makes sense
19:59:21 <gregdek> tima: keep it bookmarked. don't worry, things will settle down soon.
19:59:38 <tima> great. thanks gregdek.
19:59:39 <resmo> gregdek: did you get that? your opinion?
20:00:17 <gregdek> resmo: I'm missing the context.
20:00:25 <resmo> gregdek: no problem...
20:00:52 <gregdek> THe original purpose of "needs_rebase" was to indicate that "this doesn't merge cleanly."
20:01:00 <resmo> gregdek: bcoca says the bot should not change to needs_rebase if PR is in needs_revision
20:01:10 <gregdek> Ah.
20:01:12 <gregdek> Hm.
20:01:42 <gregdek> Well, in a sense, needs_revision is true in the strict sense. But it doesn't necessarily say all that's wrong. needs_rebase says very clearly "hey, this doesn't merge."
20:01:46 <gregdek> One thing we could do:
20:02:03 <gregdek> * Do away with "needs_rebase" since it's just another way of saying "needs_revision";
20:02:07 <rbergeron> gregdek: i have to drop off and go to our meeting around openstack summit
20:02:14 <gregdek> rbergeron: thanks!
