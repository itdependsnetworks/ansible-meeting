19:05:44 <bcoca> #topic  ansible/ansible#39960
19:06:10 <bcoca> tzurE:  seems like you got feedback about proper PR procedure, anything else you need?
19:06:21 <maxamillion> .hello2
19:06:22 <zodbot> maxamillion: maxamillion 'Adam Miller' <maxamillion@gmail.com>
19:06:38 <tzurE> All of the modules I've added are complementer
19:06:52 <tzurE> So I much rather adding them together
19:07:05 <tzurE> If it's possible
19:07:07 <bcoca> that will just make them that much harder to review
19:07:28 <bcoca> the policy is there so you start with one, get all the feedback and then probably avoid ssystemic issues with rest
19:07:53 <bcoca> giving people 6 modules to review at once ... is probably going to be skipped until nothing else is left to review
19:08:00 <tzurE> Ok. I've opened them like that because I saw other PRs of new modules that were the same, and on the IRC they told me that mostly it's ok.
19:08:03 <jtanner> the bot did link to the doc about group module PRs, but the link is broken ... so
19:08:14 <tzurE> Ok, no problem. I'll split them.
19:08:51 <jtanner> correct link https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_in_groups.html
19:08:51 <tzurE> I'll close the current PR and add the rest. Do I need to open a new review for the doc frag and the utils module as well?
19:09:06 <bcoca> those can be subm itted with first module
19:09:34 <tzurE> Ok, I'll do it. Thank you for your time.
19:09:40 <bcoca> #topic netapp permissions
19:09:58 <bcoca> schmots_:  submit a PR with the changes, just need to get the other maintainers to 'shipit'
19:10:12 <bcoca> github/BOTMETA.yml <= contains the info
19:10:38 <jtanner> bot will ping them
19:10:45 <schmots_> submitting the PR isnâ€™t our issue.  I am supposed to have rights as an approver for our company modules
19:10:56 <bcoca> this is HOW you get those rights
19:11:02 <schmots_> ah, sorry
19:11:03 <schmots_> thanks
19:11:05 <bcoca> ^ file above controls that
19:11:38 <jtanner> theoretically your github nick would go at the end of this list https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml#L1170
19:11:58 <bcoca> ^ you can also remove teh 'departed' individual
19:12:08 <schmots_> I found the file.  We will submit a PR on this.  Thank you.
19:12:18 <bcoca> #topic open floor
19:14:23 <carchi8py> Just a quick thing on the netapp permission thing. What do we need to do to get a shipit on this https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39753 We have 2 approval at this point but no shipit ppears
19:15:18 <jtanner> the newer commits reset the shipit counter
19:15:31 <ryansb> yeah, shipits don't persist across changes
19:15:32 <carchi8py> ahhh ok
19:16:19 <jtanner> preventing "bob approved, jim then adds malicious code"
19:16:34 <gundalow> jtanner: I'll review and fix links in bot messages
19:16:50 <maxamillion> jtanner: +1
19:16:53 <jtanner> gundalow: someone already sent a PR and i merged it
19:17:28 <gundalow> jtanner: oh OK :)
19:17:29 <gundalow> gw
19:17:57 <bcoca> if nothing else, closing in 1 min
19:19:06 <jtanner> i have nothing
