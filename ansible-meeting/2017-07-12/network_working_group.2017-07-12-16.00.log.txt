16:04:39 <gundalow> #info Partner Modules Submission Deadline: 2017-Jul-15
16:04:45 <gundalow> #info Partner Modules Development Freeze Date: 2017-Aug-01
16:05:23 <gundalow> #topic make panos security rule more idempotent #26573
16:05:29 <gundalow> #info https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26573
16:05:45 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: panos is community maintained, so need them to review
16:05:54 <itdependsnetwork> So to me this is bare min
16:05:56 <gundalow> How else can we help
16:06:09 * privateip waves and takes a seat
16:06:32 <itdependsnetwork> when I push a rule, what should happen? Should that rule be declarative?
16:07:04 <itdependsnetwork> I just fixed it so it doesn't fail if pushing the exact same rule
16:07:51 <itdependsnetwork> but not sure what next step should be from a standard ansible methodology. Just ensure it is there, or ensure it is as stated (declarative)
16:08:33 * trishnag waves
16:09:17 <privateip> itdependsnetwork: ideally it would be fully declarative
16:09:29 <privateip> that said .... most modules don't follow that rule today
16:09:37 <privateip> so i think your PR is appropriate
16:10:04 <itdependsnetwork> Well I am not even ensuring it is there, only if there is an exact match, don't fail
16:10:11 <itdependsnetwork> I can add that though.
16:10:40 <itdependsnetwork> then finally, when does community (I think Ivan is maintainer ) to be in by 2.4?
16:12:34 <privateip> freeze is 8/1
16:12:52 <privateip> no net new anything after that date ... only bug fixes
16:13:23 <itdependsnetwork> ok
16:13:38 <itdependsnetwork> so good on this then, will try an hunt down maintainer
16:13:58 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: :)
16:14:16 <gundalow> cool, so next
16:14:21 <privateip> he should have been cc'ed by the bot already
16:14:43 <gundalow> Bot has issue with CC'ing people over the last day or two
16:14:53 <privateip> ahh
16:15:28 <gundalow> they've been added manually by itdependsnetwork so all good
16:15:49 <gundalow> #topic Kc update ip filter #26566
16:15:54 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26566
16:16:18 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: looks good
16:16:28 <gundalow> Does this need documenting anywhere?
16:16:42 <itdependsnetwork> Probably :)
16:16:50 * gundalow isn't sure to what extent we document the filters
16:16:54 <itdependsnetwork> most of all, you good with naming?
16:17:46 <privateip> i think i already +1'ed it
16:18:00 <gundalow> merged
16:18:04 <itdependsnetwork> nice!
16:18:16 <itdependsnetwork> thanks!
16:18:25 <itdependsnetwork> good to go then :)
16:18:26 <privateip> thanks for the effort
16:18:31 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: could you raise a PR to update CHANGELOG and add a couple of lines (if you think it's worth it)
16:18:37 <itdependsnetwork> np, even though I am a pain :)
16:18:43 <privateip> lol
16:18:53 <itdependsnetwork> Sure
16:19:00 <gundalow> haha
16:19:12 <gundalow> right, I'm going to skip over nxos and do that last
16:19:14 <gundalow> so dag
16:19:27 <dag> o/
16:19:32 <gundalow> #topic network/aci/aci_rest 26029
16:19:36 <gundalow> #chair dag
16:19:36 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos caphrim007 dag funzo ganeshrn gundalow itdependsnetwork mikewiebe privateip rcarrillocruz trishnag
16:19:38 <privateip> hi dag
16:19:51 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26029
16:20:10 <dag> So I was wondering what exactly I need to do for this module, integration tests will be near impossible (no ACI infra), and I don't really see how to do unit tests here
16:20:14 * gundalow wonders if dag is going to ask about tests
16:20:17 <gundalow> oh, I was right :)
16:20:18 <dag> :-)
16:20:26 <gundalow> aye
16:20:39 <gundalow> mattclay and I have been talking a lot about unit test
16:20:40 <dag> I've heard rumors about mocking stuff
16:21:10 <gundalow> and unit tests generally don't make as much sense for modules
16:21:28 <caphrim007> i'll have to disagree with that
16:21:40 <caphrim007> my own unit tests have caught problems in my modules during dev
16:21:47 <dag> and I could capture a few rest results from real hardware, but if that's just to test the aci_response function, that's a bit moot.
16:22:09 <gundalow> caphrim007: I'm happy to be proved wrong
16:22:33 <privateip> im with caphrim007 on this one
16:22:42 <gundalow> I guess I should have said that generally speaking integration tests are better for Modules, however for Networking that can be a pain
16:22:51 <privateip> even basic mocked modules should have some unit tests
16:22:56 <dag> caphrim: I guess it really depends on the modules, this module is an interface to the low-level REST api, so there's not much more then doing a request, and parsing the result
16:23:08 <dag> so the only thing I can really tests is parsing the result
16:23:12 <privateip> if not for the initial commit but for down the road when modules get updated
16:23:18 <caphrim007> dag: i see
16:23:25 <caphrim007> mine are also to my products rest api
16:23:30 <dag> right, still don't see how that would work with this module
16:23:39 <caphrim007> but my unit tests are there to handle all of th data munging that happens between user and rest
16:23:41 <dag> any pointers ?
16:23:58 <dag> but the deadlin is 2017-07-15, so this is becoming quite urgent now
16:24:53 <gundalow> So ignoring the tests are we happy with the module
16:25:01 <privateip> +1
16:25:02 <dag> yesterday in the core meeting the freeze was in august, but a deadline announced 3 days before is a bit problematic
16:25:13 <dag> (probably this was public, I just wasn't aware)
16:25:33 <gundalow> We are working on improving comms (all of Ansible)
16:25:38 <dag> I know
16:25:42 <privateip> i believe that was the submission deadline no?
16:25:52 <privateip> you are submitted at the moment
16:26:09 <itdependsnetwork> yea I thought everything got pushed out based on yesterday's meeting
16:26:15 <gundalow> Networking people have been informed by email & this agenda in june for the 15th July PR raise deadline
16:26:19 <dag> privateip: I know it was mentioned in London during conversation, but I wasn't aware this was a submission deadline, I thought it was a target date for everything ACI
16:26:28 <dag> privateip: ah ok
16:26:56 <gundalow> So moving forward these dates will be added to ROADMAP_X.Y.rst
16:27:15 <dag> so, I'll work on some unit-tests this evening (based on caphrim007's references) and will put it on next week's agenda
16:27:22 <gundalow> dag: +1

16:31:50 <gundalow> mikewiebe: Just checking, you on for the meeting tomorrow?
16:32:11 <gundalow> rahushen: Hi
16:32:14 <mikewiebe> gundalow: yes
16:32:15 <rahushen> Hi
16:32:26 <gundalow> Qalthos: hi
16:32:27 <gundalow> right
16:33:08 <rahushen> #26617 needs to be reviewed and merged
16:33:09 <gundalow> #topic Add nxos_command IT and generalize UT #26617
16:33:21 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26617
16:34:10 <gundalow> #action Qalthos to check this passes on our test kit, if it does merge
16:34:23 * dag needs to go, thanks gundalow
16:34:24 <Qalthos> The integration tests seem to be... mostly testing nxos_bgp? I mean I see what you're doing, but this looks like the wrong way to go about a sanity check
16:34:42 <rahushen> I disagree
16:35:14 <rahushen> the module checks command ... don't really care which commands
16:35:43 <itdependsnetwork> slightly off topic, I have seen some some stuff, but how are you doing integration tests? Is this ran with each PR now?
16:36:36 <rahushen> we are running it across several platforms and improving module ITs for a few weeks now
16:37:09 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: right now we all unit test and only vyos_command get run in Shippable (ie part of GitHub CI)
16:37:33 <rcarrillocruz> not sure who you were asking that itdependsnetwork
16:37:37 <itdependsnetwork> "we all" == redhat?
16:37:38 <rcarrillocruz> rahushen , us or in general
16:37:39 <gundalow> itdependsnetwork: in addition we have a scheduled test framework that is running some of the platforms twice a day on devel
16:37:40 <rcarrillocruz> ?
16:38:20 <rcarrillocruz> we have a platform internally thhat we run periodic jobs (not on commit, but post-merge), currently VyOS, OVS and EOS
16:38:20 <rahushen> sorry, us = mikewiebe, rahushen and saichint from cisco
16:38:27 <itdependsnetwork> i'll ping you in ansible-network to not confuse more than I have :)
16:38:55 <rcarrillocruz> we plan to onboard more platforms as we get access to VM images from other vendors
16:39:46 <rcarrillocruz> the on PR testing will come too via Zuul
16:40:48 <gundalow> ok, back to NXOS, we can discuss testing in #ansible-network
16:40:51 <Qalthos> rahushen: I assume the unit changes reflect some kind of version incompatibility?
16:41:33 <rahushen> qalthos : yes, the show version output no longer matches the one in the fixtures for the newer platforms
16:41:41 <mikewiebe> Qalthos: There are already quite a few tests covering the nxos_command module.  rahushen added essentially a smoke test that can be run quickly to detect very basic issues with the module.
16:42:11 <mikewiebe> Qalthos: We picked bgp but it could have been any command that is supported on nxos.
16:44:51 <Qalthos> Alright, I have the info I need
16:45:51 <gundalow> Qalthos: Would it be easier for you to drive this section?
16:45:58 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110#issuecomment-314795342
16:46:06 <Qalthos> I'd like a bit more specificity on what is broken how for the unit tests, just in case we need to track this down later, or modify the tests further, but I'll merge it
16:46:22 * gundalow -> afk
16:46:25 <Qalthos> gundalow: sure
16:46:29 <gundalow> Thanks
16:47:20 <rahushen> qalthos .. roger that, will add a comment to PR with an explanation to the change in show ver output
16:47:20 <Qalthos> All of those bgp issues are on my list to tackle next, is there anything you want to bring up here?
16:48:03 <Qalthos> #info #26024 #26159 #2620 #26262
16:48:03 <rahushen> #26544 is not bgp related
16:48:16 <Qalthos> rahushen: I'm getting there (:
16:48:48 <Qalthos> #topic nxos_bgp_* issues #26024 #26159 #2620 #26262
16:48:52 <rahushen> nothing on the bgp ones ... just wanted to check when they'll get addressed
16:49:12 <Qalthos> rahushen: soon as it can be arranged, which should be pretty soon
16:49:28 <rahushen> qalthos - sounds good
16:49:39 <mikewiebe> Qualthos:  Just a quick note that I updated all the issues I filed with info or responses you were asking for
16:50:15 <Qalthos> mikewiebe: Roger, I'll be sure to go through those as well
16:50:24 <Qalthos> #topic nxapi not json by default in 2.4 #26544
16:50:36 <Qalthos> privateip: still here?
16:50:55 <privateip> yeah
16:50:58 <rahushen> not the best header for the issue
16:51:20 <rahushen> but it seems to me the nxapi behavior has changed over time
16:51:55 <rahushen> the IT for the nxos_command/nxapi expects structured output with '| json' which no longer is the case
16:52:10 <rahushen> without*
16:53:44 <privateip> afaik the default output for cli is structured ascii and for nxapi is json
16:53:49 <Qalthos> rahushen: I've been looking into this, and I think I might have worked out where we can turn this back
16:54:13 <rahushen> ok
16:55:10 <mikewiebe> Qualthos and privateip: We should move towards an architecture that allows us to ask for structured or non-structured output regardless of transport (nxapi or cli) and let the api do the right thing
16:56:00 <Qalthos> mikewiebe: So we do have that, you can `| json` or `output: json` (or, presumably, `outout: text`) anywhere you like
16:56:14 <privateip> mikewiebe we already have that
16:56:20 <Qalthos> and the right thing should happen
16:56:35 * privateip zips it, Qalthos has it covered
16:57:19 <Qalthos> there is a certain amount of extra munging that's happening that overrides `output: whatever`, which is also causing this issue
16:57:53 <Qalthos> but What I really want to know is if it makes any sense to have different output formats for different transports
16:58:07 <Qalthos> (by default anyway)
16:58:13 <mikewiebe> I have seen that but I think there are a few cases where it does not work as expected.  I will collect data but in general we don't use | jason for nxapi structured.  We build the http request with a tag that means structured output desired
16:58:25 <mikewiebe> | json
16:59:25 <privateip> yeah im pretty sure we catch that, drop the | json and set the request field correctly
16:59:29 <Qalthos> mikewiebe: as do we internally, it is only for user convenience, the `| json` gets stripped and the request is built properly
17:00:13 <mikewiebe> Qualthos: You are referring to the methods in module_utils/nxos right?
17:00:51 <Qalthos> mikewiebe: Those ones, yes
17:01:09 <mikewiebe> Qalthos: Ok.
17:01:23 <Qalthos> I think we're getting a tad off-track though
17:02:31 <Qalthos> privateip: mikewiebe is https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/26544 an issue in that the transports have different expectations
17:02:54 <Qalthos> or do we want to preserve that difference for a reason
17:03:59 <mikewiebe> rahushen:  You have more background on that issue.  Can you comment?
17:04:42 <rahushen> historically, it's been json by default for nxapi
17:05:47 <Qalthos> that is the most compelling reason anyone has been able to give me, and I
17:06:00 <Qalthos> 'm willing to fix the issue on that basis
17:06:16 <Qalthos> unless anyone else has any ideas, we can move on
17:07:26 <Qalthos> Okay, then
17:07:52 <Qalthos> #topic nxos_acl_interface tests #26616
17:08:25 <Qalthos> mikewiebe: I am more confused than the last time I looked at this, is `feature nxapi snadbox` a thing?
17:08:36 <Qalthos> er, s/snad/sand/
17:09:03 <Qalthos> okay, I take it back, you removed it
17:09:08 <Qalthos> merging
17:09:10 <mikewiebe> Qualthos: Nope.. :)
17:09:26 <mikewiebe> Thanks!
17:10:13 <Qalthos> #topic not NXOS
17:10:22 <Qalthos> we did #26029, right?
