Meeting summary
---------------
* Agenda https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/248  (mattclay,
  17:02:32)
* Azure quota  (gundalow, 17:03:07)
  * We've had an increase in Azure tests lately and may be hitting the
    quota due to that. Tests that don't clean up after themselves
    properly could also be responsible. If the tests don't clean up when
    finished it can take longer for resources to be removed,
    particularly if jobs are canceled before finishing.  (gundalow,
