Meeting summary
---------------
* There isn't a lot to announce this week. However, one change I thought
  worth mentioning is that ansible-test now checks to make sure
  ~/.ssh/known_hosts isn't changed during a test run. This was added to
  avoid issues like the one I fixed with the git test where it deleted
  the file.  (gundalow, 17:04:34)
* Use of test_pull_requests label  (gundalow, 17:04:48)
  * Currently the `test_pull_requests` label gets applied to a PR if
    *any* file under ./test gets changed. So we often end up with that
    label added even if someone has just tied up pep8. This makes
    searching for PRs that add/alter tests a pain  (gundalow, 17:06:07)
  * Should we ignore ./test/sanity/?  (gundalow, 17:06:26)
  * ACTION: just ignore legacy-files.txt  (gundalow, 17:09:15)

* Installation of Integration Test Requirements  (mattclay, 17:12:29)

* Open Floor  (mattclay, 17:40:18)

Meeting ended at 17:46:49 UTC.
