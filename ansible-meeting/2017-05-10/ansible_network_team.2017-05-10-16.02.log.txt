16:12:30 <trishnag> +1
16:12:58 <akasurde> One quick question - is there any doc for improvment in Network modules ?
16:13:15 <akasurde> I mean - expected improvement
16:13:57 <gundalow> akasurde: How do you mean?
16:15:03 <akasurde> gundalow, Let us say I have x module then what kind of improvment , are we looking - or is it case by case decided ?
16:16:21 <gundalow> We (Ansible Network Team) have an action to produce some documentation on *how* to write network modules, which will include some best practice stuff as well as coding requirements. Is that what you mean?
16:16:29 <gundalow> The above will be Network specific
16:16:46 <akasurde> gundalow, Yes. thats what I meant
16:16:57 <akasurde> gundalow, thanks for elaborating me :)
