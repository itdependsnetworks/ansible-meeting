* Question: Should people with Commit powers update PR for someone else
  (gundalow, 15:48:34)
* Question: If a PR only needs a simple fix before merge should that be
  fixed then merged  (gundalow, 15:51:58)
* Add more into Sanity tests for these things  (gundalow, 15:52:13)
* If it's a PR older than n-months then asking them the author to update
  isn't good  (gundalow, 15:54:04)
* Can we automate `version_added`  (gundalow, 15:54:28)
* jlk: I do think Ansible should take the approach other projects have
  taken. "Your submission is great and it is nearly complete. Thank you,
  we'll fix up the rest and merge it."  Focus on getting the code in
  rather than doing back/forth to have the contributor have a "perfect"
  contributio  (gundalow, 15:56:36)
* Should we add commits to PRs that we will not merge - Things are lost
  by force push?  (gundalow, 15:59:36)
* First PR comment for new_contributors, give them some extra guidance,
  extra thanks. Make it clearer to reviews that this is a new
  contributor and may need guidance,
