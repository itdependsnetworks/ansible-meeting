14:59:32 <Pilou> There are some PR with shipit label which aren't merged: should they mentionned here ?
15:00:03 <bcoca> possibly, but those most likely touch a 'core' supported file and wont be automerged .. i believe the same is true with tests

15:09:01 <sivel> nothing from me
15:09:05 <bcoca> #topic https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/17
15:11:12 <bcoca> ^ anyone have any thoughts?
15:12:42 <bcoca> k, seems dead today , just going to end meeting
15:12:47 <bcoca> in 1min
15:13:00 <sdoran> I'm in favor of a fact gathering framework, a way to allow custom fact gathering/target specific fact gathering that doesn't require adding tasks to the play.
15:13:23 <sdoran> But this ends up turning into the "redo the entire setup/fact gathering framework" conversation.
15:13:35 <sdoran> To make it more pluggable.
15:13:55 <bcoca> well, 2 diff frameworks, autofact gathering and the 'setup module'
15:14:08 <bcoca> i think we only want to tackle the first
15:14:16 <sdoran> I may be conflating the two.
15:14:23 <bcoca> they are related
15:14:49 <bcoca> and currently hardcoded, so i think if we separate and expand the first, the 2nd can be dealt with later and in easier way
15:15:31 <bcoca> keep it as default, but make it configurable to allow, specially 'non unix' machines, to work better w/o having to gather_facts: no + sepcific fact task in every play
15:16:27 <sdoran> It does need to be OS/inventory related. Since Ansible gathers data on many non *nix OSs today. And I agree that disabling fact gathering on everything but Linux is odd.
15:19:37 <bcoca> let me try again on tuesday, seems we dont have enough people here for quorum
15:19:44 <sdoran> Agreed.
