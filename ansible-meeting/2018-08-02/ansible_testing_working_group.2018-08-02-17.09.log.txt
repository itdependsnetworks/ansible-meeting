17:09:52 <gundalow> #topic `passlib` for RHEL instance
17:10:16 <gundalow> #info sdoran is adding some tests for `var_prompts`, which needs `passlib`
17:10:29 <sdoran> It looks like the RHEL test instance is the only one that does not have the `passlib` library installed.
17:10:41 <gundalow> sdoran: I guess because of how this works `passlib` needs to be installed *before* ansible-playbook is invoked
17:11:01 <sdoran> I'm doing it in the `runme.sh` currently
17:11:12 <gundalow> nice
17:11:18 <sdoran> But since it's the only test instance that _doesn't_ have it, I figured it would good to add.
17:11:30 <gundalow> Sure, let me look to see where that is defined
17:12:13 <sdoran> I found something that looks like it's installing packages in `ansible/test/runner/setup/remote.sh`.
17:12:20 <sdoran> But I'm not sure if that is only for remote shells or not.
17:15:22 <gundalow> sdoran: Looking at the RHEL output in Shippable I can see `ec2-user@ec2-18-212-247-114.compute-1.amazonaws.com sudo -in bash -c ''"'"'chmod +x /tmp/remote.sh && /tmp/remote.sh rhel'"'"''`
17:15:45 <sdoran> Ok, then that's the place.
17:15:52 <gundalow> and just before that `test/runner/setup/remote.sh` being scp'd over
17:16:01 <sdoran> If that's ok to add, I'll submit a PR.
17:16:29 <gundalow> #action sdoran 1 )So in your PR you should be able to update `test/runner/setup/remote.sh` to install `passlib` 2) and remove from `runme.sh`
17:16:44 <gundalow> (trying to remember to actually put stuff in the logs for a change :P)
17:16:52 <gundalow> sdoran: Ace, if you have any issues shout out
17:17:00 <sdoran> üëç
17:17:16 <gundalow> Anything else on that, otherwise we can move onto bcoca's suggestion
17:19:04 <gundalow> #topic automerge vs label:shipit with PRs with tests
17:20:38 <gundalow> Just trying to find an example PR that has shipit and tests, everything so far also contains module_utils
17:21:46 <bcoca> 2 tower_ module ones this mornign that didnt have module_utils but did have tests/
17:22:44 <gundalow> cool
17:23:10 <bcoca> i merged manually, but didnt see why they should wait when tests only affect the module itself and has shipits from maintainers
17:23:39 <bcoca> i would understand if they are chaning how asnible-tests works or some of the 'shared' resources across tests .. but this seemed benigng
17:23:39 <gundalow> Yup, totally
17:23:46 <bcoca> er .. izpell
17:24:02 <bcoca> wanted to consult with 'testing' before asking ansibullbot for feature
17:24:37 <gundalow> So iff `test/integration/target/$modulename/` and `$modulename` is covered by shipit
17:24:50 <bcoca> yep
17:25:12 <bcoca> though eventually i think other plugins might do same, i.e lookup/cyberark
17:25:21 <bcoca> but modules are most of the 'traffic'
17:25:44 <bcoca> since we now require them to submit tests when possible, it basically invalidates 'automerge'
17:26:53 <gundalow> +1
17:27:23 <bcoca> matt out? do we have quorum enough to make decision?
17:27:33 <gundalow> #agreed that we should honor `label:shipit` for PRs that also touch `test/integration/target/$modulename/``
17:27:39 <gundalow> Matt's out, I've made a decision
17:27:47 <bcoca> works4me
17:27:52 <gundalow> You happy to raise an issue?
17:27:57 <gundalow> against ansibullbot?
17:28:13 <bcoca> yep, just didnt want to do it and then have you guys oppose it for 'reasons' which i didnt know
17:28:25 <gundalow> #action bcoca to raise issue against ansibullbot
