16:02:20 <funzo> Ansible 2.2.3 FINAL released, 2.1.6rc1 and 2.3.1rc1 available for testing
16:02:20 <funzo> All of these releases address at least one CVE (listed below). Users of 2.2.x should upgrade to 2.2.3 as soon as possible. The CVE impacting 2.1.x and 2.3.0 is MODERATE in nature, however users should look to upgrade as soon as the final releases are done.
