16:14:09 <gundalow> Hi
16:14:18 <gundalow> Ansible 2.2 RC2 is out, please test. No more networking changes are expected https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/ansible-devel/s62oSsxTUZc
16:15:11 <caphrim007> gundalow: can i get a merge for any outstanding PR's i have for 2.3/devel?
16:15:31 <gundalow> caphrim007: skg-net If you both have time to run through your test cases with 2.2 RC2, that would be really good
16:15:56 <gundalow> caphrim007: oh, sure, I didn't realise anything was waiting on me
16:16:08 <caphrim007> well some of it is waiting for privateip
16:16:16 <caphrim007> or you if he's afk
16:16:34 <gundalow> Privateip is on holiday the rest of this week
16:16:45 <caphrim007> then i choose you pikachu
16:17:02 * gundalow can merge into devel. I'm not happy to merge anything into 2.2 at this stage without getting an extra set of eyes
16:17:05 <gundalow> lol :)
16:17:16 <caphrim007> yeah i dont have 2.2 changes, only 2.3
16:17:41 <caphrim007> i'll mention you in the prs so you can see them
16:17:51 <gundalow> caphrim007: https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acaphrim007+is%3Aopen the new_plugin ones?
16:18:01 <caphrim007> yeah
16:18:05 <bcoca> 2.2 is in RC, nothing should be merged w/o discussing with release manager
16:18:15 <gundalow> bcoca: yup :)
16:18:22 <gundalow> Is that Jimi?
16:19:34 <skg-net> gundalow: we are running against 2.2 RC2
16:20:09 <gundalow> skg-net: cool. I've not seen any bug reports or PRs so I assume you've done a full run on 2.2 RC2 and it's all green?
16:20:26 <skg-net> The email said, lot of networking bug fixes, do you have list
16:20:55 <gundalow> Not to hand, but I'll email you one
16:21:03 <skg-net> Yes, thats correct
16:21:11 <gundalow> caphrim007: if you PM me your email address I'll send it to you as well if you want
16:21:21 <caphrim007> ok
16:22:22 <skg-net> did you know whether @privateip got a chance to upload the vendor agnostic role from AnsibleFest
16:22:58 <gundalow> skg-net: Not that I'm aware of, I'll add it to our internal list
16:23:10 <skg-net> ok thanks
16:24:20 <gundalow> caphrim007: Does https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/3175 need to go into 2,2?
16:24:43 <caphrim007> in a perfect world, but its not a total disaster if it doesnt
16:24:58 <caphrim007> it can go in a .1 release if needed
16:25:15 <gundalow> I'd be suprised if there wasn't another RC, though you never know
16:25:41 <caphrim007> the bug doesnt affect any running config, it just affects the reported changed-ness
16:28:56 <gundalow> Cool added 1) F5 new modules 2) F5 bug 3) Get vendor agnostic role. All into https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
16:29:36 <gundalow> skg-net: was it specifically between 2.2 RC1 and RC2?
16:29:51 <gundalow> skg-net: was it specifically what's changed between 2.2 RC1 and RC2?
16:42:10 <gundalow> cool so if nothing else I'll end the meeting
