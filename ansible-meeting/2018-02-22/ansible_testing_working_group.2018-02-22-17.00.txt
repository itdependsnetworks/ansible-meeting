* The "code smell" sanity tests are getting an overhaul. The existing
  scripts in `test/sanity/code-smell/` are being converted to python
  from shell scripts and are being more tightly integrated with
  ansible-test. This is an iterative process, so tests will be converted
  across multiple PRs and then further updates will be made later to
  refine the integration.  (mattclay, 17:07:49)
