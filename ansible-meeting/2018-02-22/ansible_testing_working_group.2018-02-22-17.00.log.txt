17:03:24 <mattclay> gundalow: Any updates from you?
17:03:54 <gundalow> Been chipping away at validate-modules/ignore.txt
17:04:04 <sivel> it's a big list :)
17:04:14 <gundalow> well, it got longer recently:(
17:04:33 <mattclay> That's not all bad -- it means we're checking for more things.
17:04:47 <gundalow> Though I've noticed it spotting a lot of issues with brand new PRs/modules, so it's really good
17:04:50 <gundalow> I know :)
17:05:43 <sivel> we've gotten some positive comments about the arg_spec/doc comparisons from maintainers.  So that  is a win
17:06:00 <gundalow> Yup, likewise
17:07:35 <sivel> mattclay: I showed this yesterday, and to gundalow earlier, but I wrote up some instructions on creating backport PRs
17:07:37 <sivel> https://gist.github.com/sivel/a87d61421a5605b33fe1efcf727c9065
17:07:45 <sivel> should help if people follow that to test the backports
17:07:49 <mattclay> #info The "code smell" sanity tests are getting an overhaul. The existing scripts in `test/sanity/code-smell/` are being converted to python from shell scripts and are being more tightly integrated with ansible-test. This is an iterative process, so tests will be converted across multiple PRs and then further updates will be made later to refine the integration.
17:08:51 <mattclay> sivel: We'll need to be careful about assuming names of remotes. Not everyone uses "upstream".
17:09:09 <sivel> mattclay: if you have any comments on that gist, let me know.  I'll see about adding it our docs
17:09:18 <sivel> I can add some more "notes"
17:10:26 <mattclay> sivel: A PR would be good. I'm sure nitzmahone will have some feedback on the part about creating changelog entries. We'll want to make sure it's a very complete set of instructions we can point people at to avoid repeating ourselves as much as possible.
17:10:51 <sivel> yeah, I just kinda glossed over changelog, as there are different ways for different branches right now
17:11:01 <sivel> maybe a separate doc section about changelogs
17:11:41 <nitzmahone> Yeah- once it's pretty well settled and merged to devel, I/we will definitely need some docs and tooling around that.
17:11:45 <gundalow> Yup, changelog should be it's own section
17:11:58 <gundalow> though, oh hi nitzmahone, probs not worth it yet
17:12:01 <mattclay> #chair nitzmahone

17:12:02 <zodbot> Current chairs: gundalow mattclay nitzmahone sivel
17:12:05 <nitzmahone> exactly
17:12:06 <gundalow> :D
17:12:44 <nitzmahone> I figure we'll probably start tightening that stuff down during the 2.6 timeframe
17:16:07 <gundalow> So I did have some comments around community engagement, etc, though I guess no point going through those
17:18:50 <gundalow> Will close the meeting shortly
