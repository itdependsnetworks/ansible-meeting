Meeting summary
---------------
* Bulk code tidyups (autopep8)  (gundalow, 15:04:13)
  * As you all know we have a pep8 standard enforced by `ansible-test
    sanity --test pep8`  (gundalow, 15:04:40)
  * There are a number of files that are not compliant, which are listed
    in test/sanity/pep8/legacy-files.txt  (gundalow, 15:05:12)
  * There is a slow trickle of PRs to address pep8. Generally done by
    hand, and as is the way when humans are involved, then sometimes
    contains mistakes that are not spotted during review (such as
    missing `,` in lists)  (gundalow, 15:06:32)
  * I propose that we run `autopep8 -r  --max-line-length 160 --in-place
    --ignore E305,E402,E722,E741 .` against the codebase  (gundalow,
    15:07:03)
  * PR1: autopep8 for modules  (gundalow, 15:07:15)
  * PR2: hand crafted fixes for issues that autopep8 doesn't fix modules
    (gundalow, 15:07:43)
  * pr3 & pr4 same for non-modules  (gundalow, 15:07:53)
  * AGREED: 11 (core) and 1 (comiter, but not core) people agreed to do
    this. Only -1 was from bcoca  (gundalow, 15:16:49)
  * HELP:   (gundalow, 15:16:56)
  * HELP:   (gundalow, 15:17:01)

* Bulk code tidyups (non-pep8 related)  (gundalow, 15:25:31)
  * agreed A) Although `required: false` and `default: null` are
    redundent (as they are the default), removing them isn't required as
    they are just "redundent" rather than "incorrect". If while working
    on a modules and making improvements to the DOCUMENTATION, such as
    improveing the `descriptions` you wish to remove these lines, that
    is fine, though not required.  (gundalow, 15:44:28)
  * agreed B) Understand that PRs that improve the module for a users
    point of view (improved docs, bug fixes, error handling) are much
    more welcome that style only PRs. Generally speaking we do not
    welcome style only PRs, there is still overhead in triaging PRs.
    (gundalow, 15:44:51)
  * agreed C) PRs that improve the quality of module documentation,
    including propper use of C(..), I(...), M(...), U(...) are welcome
    (gundalow, 15:45:05)
  * ACTION: Gundalow to document ABC + update docs for pep8 (given
    autopep8)  (gundalow, 15:45:24)
  * AGREED: A) Although `required: false` and `default: null` are
    redundent (as they are the default), removing them isn't required as

    (gundalow, 15:46:24)
  * AGREED: C) PRs that improve the quality of module documentation,
    including propper use of C(..), I(...), M(...), U(...) are welcome.
    Changes that improve docs/docsite/ are always welcome - In this
    context doc/ui/presentation/formatting IS important  (gundalow,
    15:47:34)

* Open Floor  (gundalow, 15:51:48)
  * LINK:
