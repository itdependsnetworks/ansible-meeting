15:06:44 <bcoca> #topic open floor
15:08:26 <abadger1999> Hello
15:08:52 <jtanner> do we need to discuss the tags/blocks/includes thing?
15:09:38 <bcoca> sivel: didnt you add that to agenda?
15:09:42 <sivel> I don't think so. I think we basically decided things work as expected, and provided a comprehensive update in the ticket
15:10:04 <bcoca> ah, works4me
15:10:18 <bcoca> ^ anyone care to disent now?
15:10:25 <maxamillion> +1
15:10:36 <sivel> as of now, "works as expected"
15:10:53 <jtanner> k
15:10:54 <bcoca> expected, designed, desired by authors
15:11:16 <jtanner> #chair dag
15:11:16 <zodbot> Current chairs: bcoca dag gundalow jtanner mkrizek ryansb
15:11:19 <bcoca> once we add 'inherit' i think we are good, just need to add examples with 'alwways' and document well how tags work
15:11:21 <jtanner> #chair rcarrillocruz
15:11:21 <zodbot> Current chairs: bcoca dag gundalow jtanner mkrizek rcarrillocruz ryansb
15:11:46 <sdoran> So long as we have something planned for enabling inheritance on the roadmap for those that want that feature.
15:12:00 <sdoran> Which I believe is the case.
15:12:01 <sivel> it's on the not yet created 2.7 roadmap
15:12:07 <sdoran> Yup.
15:12:30 <sdoran> I got some further info on that use case.
15:13:12 <sdoran> Esentially adding tags to a dynamically included role that you do not own.
15:13:45 <sdoran> Since networking is moving towards creating roles, the concern is how those things will/won't be tagged inside the role.
15:14:41 <sivel> yep, understood
15:16:11 <bcoca> sdoran: that is same use case as for include_tasks and inheriting tags
15:16:24 <bcoca> coverd by same solution, 'inherit' keyword
15:16:42 <bcoca> workaround is also same, block
15:17:05 <bcoca> or use the 'roles:' keyword, but its not nearlly as flexible as include_role
15:17:13 <sdoran> <nod>
15:17:55 <bcoca> so if no new business, closing meeting in 1 min
15:19:16 <bcoca> #endmeeting
