19:11:27 <gundalow> adds tests to defend debs
19:11:43 <gundalow> and rpm builds

19:13:29 * gregdek looks
19:14:34 <gregdek> so what's it do?
19:14:43 <gregdek> I can read, but it doesn't mean I can understand :)
19:14:47 <gregdek> what's breaking?
19:15:50 <gregdek> (looks like bcoca and others have already given feedback though)
19:16:47 <gregdek> sivel bcoca abadger1999 ^^^ any comment?
19:17:07 <sivel> yo, not paying attention

19:17:59 <sivel> ok
19:18:14 <gregdek> Anything else?
19:18:24 <gundalow> not from me
19:19:46 <abadger1999> Looks okay to me. gundalow You checked that locally?
19:20:25 <abadger1999> Hmm... Okay, one thought.
19:20:38 <abadger1999> Instead of instaling the deps every time, maybe we can add them to the docker images?
19:21:12 <gundalow> oh, that would be great
19:21:35 <abadger1999> I don't know how to do that... so probably ping jimi|ansible about doing it that way.
19:21:39 <abadger1999> Otherwise +1
19:21:50 <gundalow> excellent idea. Should speed it up a little bit
19:21:52 <gregdek> Yeah, gotta think that would speed this up quite a bit
19:21:52 <gundalow> Thanks
19:21:58 <gregdek> OK.
19:22:24 <gregdek> I'll leave the meeting in open floor until :30 and then close if no one else has anything.
19:22:47 <gregdek> (and will be doing other stuff in the meantime, so ping me if you have a topic)
19:22:54 <gundalow> jimi = @jimi-c?
19:24:10 <gundalow> abadger1999: cool thanks
19:24:11 <abadger1999> gundalow: yep.  and I just added a comment with him CC'd
