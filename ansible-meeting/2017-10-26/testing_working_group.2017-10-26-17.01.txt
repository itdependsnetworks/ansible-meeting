Meeting summary
---------------
* Agenda https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/248  (mattclay,
  17:01:47)
* We're now using our own Docker container on Shippable for tests where
  we previously used their standard build container.  (mattclay,
  17:06:41)
* This container can be used locally as well with the `--docker default`
  option to `ansible-test`, such as `ansible-test sanity --docker
  default`.  (mattclay, 17:07:32)
* The container supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6 (by
  default) so you can also use the `--python` option.  (mattclay,
  17:08:33)
* Docker images are now pinned so new versions must go through CI before
  being used. Previously a rebuild on Docker Hub would cause them to be
  used immediately.  (mattclay, 17:10:02)
* Handling of python and pip versions in ansible-test has been corrected
  for many scenarios where it did not previously work properly.
  (mattclay, 17:11:52)
* The pylint tests are now split up to run on different parts of the
  codebase with different configs. Configs are now at
  `test/sanity/pylint/config/`.  (mattclay, 17:13:10)
* I'll be on PTO Friday and all next week. For testing related issues,
  see gundalow.  (mattclay, 17:13:31)
