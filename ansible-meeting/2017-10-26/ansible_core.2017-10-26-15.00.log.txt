15:10:52 <albertom> add me
15:10:53 <albertom> @powerbsd
15:10:55 <albertom> :)
15:10:55 <gundalow> sivel: did you want to demo your template tool?
15:11:13 <gundalow> thaumos: You know that thing I never wrote a proposal for, well sivel just made it
15:11:20 <sivel> Dunno how much demoing I can do
15:11:32 <sivel> but if anyone wants to go look at https://ansible.sivel.net/test/
15:11:44 <sivel> It is a UI for testing templates via ansible
15:12:09 <sivel> it doesn't have all deps for all things that can be done in templates right now, like jmespath
15:12:26 <thaumos> nifty
15:12:32 <albertom> (y)
15:12:35 <sivel> and it does the work in a docker container, so if you really want to {{ lookup('pipe', 'rm -rf /') }}
15:12:38 <sivel> feel free ;)
15:12:52 <sivel> it's limited to a 3s execution and 96M of ram right now
15:13:10 <sivel> code: https://github.com/sivel/ansible-template-ui
15:13:11 <thaumos> #info if anyone would like to test out an Ansible Template/variable UI check out this link
15:13:15 <thaumos> #link https://ansible.sivel.net/test/
15:14:52 <gundalow> sivel: hum, is that only the standard templates, or does it know about the Ansible stuff?
15:14:58 * gundalow doesn't see it using any Ansible code
15:15:13 <sivel> gundalow: it creates a template, and a vars file, and actually runs ansible
15:15:52 <gundalow> oh, that;s in server.py, gotcha
15:15:57 <sivel> https://github.com/sivel/ansible-template-ui/tree/master/docker/devel
15:16:07 <sivel> that is the Dockerfile, the cmd it executes and the playbook
15:16:31 <gundalow> cool, was looking in the wrong place
15:16:56 <sivel> yeah, server.py effectively has a single route, that lauches the docker container, and then grabs the stdout and stderr and relays back to the browser
15:20:49 <thaumos> anything else to chat about folks?
15:20:57 <thaumos> if not, seems like we should close this out for today.
15:21:23 <gundalow> Nothing else from me
15:26:48 <thaumos> alrighty then!
15:26:54 <thaumos> have a great rest of the day folks
