* Core updates  (gundalow, 17:01:30)
  * Ansible 2.3 RC1 has been released
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-devel/V2ESSQqLnS0
    Pleeeeeeeeeeease test it and report bugs  (gundalow, 17:01:53)
  * Ansible 2.3 contians lots of changes to the *network* modules, so if
    you use any of those
    pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese test those a
    well  (gundalow, 17:02:30)
  * Devel is now 2.4, which no longer support Python 2.4 (the
    requirement is py 2.6+ & 3.5+).  (gundalow, 17:03:26)
  * Be mindfull of the above when you need to backport tests or
    functional changes to stable-2.3. As always PRs should be used when
    making changes to branches to allow CI to run  (gundalow, 17:04:27)

* Ubuntu 12.04 EOL  (gundalow, 17:05:49)
  * Ubuntu 12.04 goes EOL (End Of Live) in April, when should we remove
    it from our CI pipeline  (gundalow, 17:06:28)
  * Dylan personally says we are OK to no longer test Ubuntu 12.04 on
    devel, though he is going to check with "the business"  (gundalow,
    17:19:02)
  * AGREED: will park decission making process till Dylan has reported
    back  (gundalow, 17:20:33)

  * Docs on Ansible 2.4 support

  * LINK: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=733153
    appears to be related to why the test_ec2_asg test with the load
    balancer times out. But I haven't figured out the solution yet.
    (shertel, 18:15:00)

* structured way to reuse tests for both normal mode and check-mode
  testing  (gundalow, 18:26:58)
  * I'd [Dag] like to discuss a structured way to reuse tests for both
    normal mode and check-mode testing, and also discuss the use of YAML
    anchors and references for doing idempotency testing. Since I would
    like to redo all the Windows integration tests (some are simply
    missing) I would like to get approval on the preferred mechanism.
    (gundalow, 18:27:15)
  * See this example :
