15:04:28 <mikedlr> Hi.
15:06:14 <bcoca> hmm , no signs of life, a bug has 1/2 the team sick, i think @alikins_ might be down for the count
15:06:20 * bcoca really wants a nap
15:06:40 <cyberpear_> :( sorry to hear that
15:06:52 <devyani7> bcoca, thanks. I'll ping alikins on the PR itself.

15:08:26 <bcoca> @abadger1999 seems like you were last one to have questions on this one?
15:08:36 <cyberpear_> it's got one shipit and one question
15:09:17 <sdoran> Is the desire for it to default to providing facts on all projects?
15:09:19 <bcoca> need another from openstack guys
15:09:34 <sdoran> That seems like a change in behavior along with the new feature.
15:09:35 <bcoca> sdoran: default is 'no'
15:10:08 <sdoran> Default for bools is no? I always forget and have to check.
15:10:28 <bcoca> false
15:10:29 <bcoca> none
15:10:34 <bcoca> all defaults are None
15:10:41 <bcoca> i added comment
15:10:44 <sdoran> Ok.
15:11:20 <sdoran> Then as long as `cloud.list_servers()` is ok with `None`, that should be ok (as you put in the comment)
15:12:03 <bcoca> ^ no clue on the OS api side, but it is ok on the arg_spec
15:15:23 <bcoca> k, sdoran leaving merge up to you
15:15:27 <bcoca> #open floor
15:15:34 <jdelaros11> bcoca, question about PR 47462 that you merged a few mins ago: for community-supported code in module_utils, continue coming here? Ansibot will not merge even with 2 shipits. I thought there was a PR to change that.
15:15:34 <bcoca> #topic open floor
15:15:41 * bcoca really needs a nap
15:15:52 <bcoca> jdelaros11: no, ping us in #ansible-devel or ML
15:16:12 <jdelaros11> Got it, thanks
15:16:24 <bcoca> its normally much faster/easier, this should be last resort
15:17:39 <bcoca> k, if nothing new closing in 1 min
