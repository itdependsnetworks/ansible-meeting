19:05:58 <aalexmonteiro> @thaumos no problem
19:07:53 <aalexmonteiro> It is important that sivel attend a meeting because he reviewed my PR and asked some questions
19:08:09 <thaumos> he most likely won't be here this week
19:08:10 <ryansb> heya
19:08:15 <thaumos> maybe thurs

19:08:43 <thaumos> if we don't get many more attendees in the next couple of minutes, I'll endmeeting
19:09:44 <thaumos> @aalexmonteiro, at minimum, I'll make sure we get somewhere with an answer
19:10:25 <aalexmonteiro> @thaumos ok
19:10:26 * gundalow waves (half here)
19:10:57 <thaumos> I am thinking  we're going to cancel.
19:11:16 <thaumos> there's not enough heads here to make decisions or do anything with two topics
19:11:46 <thaumos> any opposed
19:11:47 <thaumos> ?
19:12:10 <aalexmonteiro> about my PR is something that should have a good part of the team to decide
19:12:45 <eikef> It's alright. I'd like the PR committed, but it's waiting on approval of sivel's requested changes (and has one other shipit once that is done)
19:13:19 <sdoran> All the changes sivel requested have been made.
19:13:25 <sdoran> I'm ok to merge it
19:13:33 <thaumos> thanks for doing that sdoran
19:14:26 <aalexmonteiro> on both topics it is important sivel to participate
19:14:36 <thaumos> @aalexmonteiro, are you and./or the other person on the PR thread a part of HPE?
19:15:37 <aalexmonteiro> @thaumos yep

19:16:17 <shertel> \o
19:17:23 <thaumos> ok, I'll dm you
