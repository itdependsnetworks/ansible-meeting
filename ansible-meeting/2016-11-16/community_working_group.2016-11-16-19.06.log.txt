19:10:44 <resmo> Hi
19:11:56 <resmo> quite here, I would have something to discuss but no especially related to community
19:12:14 <resmo> s/quite/quiet/
19:12:18 <resmo> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/2816
19:13:36 * gundalow waves
19:14:56 <resmo> it has a shipit but I don't know if this is a good approach
19:15:19 <resmo> I commented on a backport PR of it https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/2724#issuecomment-260744591
19:21:58 <alikins> why was it reverted originally?
19:25:35 <alikins> commit message on the revert is 'revert must_exist' so I have no idea
19:54:06 <abadger1999> bcoca: ^
19:54:54 <bcoca> iirc that created several bugs in service and failed_when could do same w/o the bugs
19:55:06 <bcoca> also in process of deprecating service module
19:58:24 <bcoca> resmo: i agree, not good aproach, i rejected once, got merged, produced issues, i reverted and rejected again ... but seems it does not want to die
