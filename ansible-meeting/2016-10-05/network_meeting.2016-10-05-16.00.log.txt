16:00:11 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos gundalow
16:00:18 * gundalow waves
16:00:26 <gundalow> rollcall
16:00:42 * caphrim__ here
16:00:44 <gundalow> Agenda as always is https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
16:01:07 <gundalow> #topic F5 PRs
16:01:08 * Qalthos waves
16:01:25 <gundalow> Copyright notice https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/3081
16:01:38 <gundalow> Fixes the enabled_vlans argument https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/3061
16:02:14 <caphrim__> and i added this one lat second https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/3095
16:02:46 <gundalow> caphrim__: does 3061 need WIP removing (which I previously added so I didn't merge it)
16:03:21 <caphrim__> i havent heard back from the person who originally sent the pr that added the functionality, but we're getting to that point of no return
16:03:26 <gundalow> 3095 - MERGED
16:03:32 <caphrim__> so i thinking its ready
16:03:43 <caphrim__> so that i dont have to undo an argument after a major release
16:04:20 <gundalow> cool
16:04:25 * gundalow removes "WIP"
16:04:44 <caphrim__> there are some other arguments in that module that, in hindsight, were probably not the best choice of names
16:04:53 <caphrim__> but i'll leave that change for a future major release
16:05:01 <caphrim__> as i'll have to likely support them for a while longer
16:05:30 <gundalow> cool, those three look good so we can merge and cherrypick for ansible-modules-extras 2.2
16:05:37 <caphrim__> ok
16:08:07 <gundalow> any other F5 bits?
16:08:20 <caphrim__> only those 3 this week
16:08:24 <gundalow> ACK
16:08:31 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:11:37 <gundalow> Anyone else?
16:13:23 <caphrim__> crickets
16:15:26 <gundalow> caphrim__: Qalthos has merged those three PRs into devel & cherrypicked into stable-2.2
16:15:38 <caphrim__> thanks Qalthos and gundalow!
16:16:07 <gundalow> So they will be released in Ansible 2.2 RC2. Which given it's Ansible Fest on Tuesday I'm not sure when that will be
16:16:10 <gundalow> skg-net: hi :)
16:17:02 * skg-net waves
16:17:31 <gundalow> skg-net: Anything for the meeting this week?
16:17:52 <gundalow> Who has tested their network code with Ansible 2.2 RC1?
16:18:00 <skg-net> gundalow: nope
16:18:51 <caphrim__> i believe i am running the most recent github code in a virtualenv when my tests run
16:19:55 <gundalow> cool
16:20:23 <gundalow> Just want to ensure all the functionality you've got is correct before we release :)
16:24:37 <gundalow> Those of you at AnsibleFest next week have fun
16:24:58 <gundalow> and remember Monday is Contributors summit https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-contributor-summit-brooklyn-2016
