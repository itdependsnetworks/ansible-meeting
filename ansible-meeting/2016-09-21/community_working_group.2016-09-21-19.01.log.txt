19:03:08 <gregdek> :)
19:03:38 <gregdek> rbergeron is gonna be maybe 10m late, so gonna wait for her to kick off in earnest.
19:03:41 <gregdek> Until then:
19:03:46 <gregdek> #topic open floor
19:03:54 <gundalow> gregdek: What's the plan for moving ansibull-bot from you to a different account?
19:04:17 <gregdek> gundalow: I don't really have a plan. I'm waiting for someone to pick that up.
19:04:38 <gundalow> eek
19:04:39 <misc> didn't github announced some plan for service account ?
19:04:40 * gundalow hides
19:05:17 <gregdek> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
19:05:35 <gregdek> That would be cool.
19:05:48 <gregdek> But I haven't heard about it.
19:06:01 <gregdek> It would be an ideal solution.
19:09:08 <rbergeron> hey! i'm two minutes early on my 10 minutes late
19:09:12 <gregdek> w00t!
19:09:18 <gregdek> Agenda, as always:

19:11:10 <rbergeron> gregdek: want to slot some time tomorrow to sort it out?
19:11:18 <rbergeron> as i, i can schedule our schedule tim
19:11:19 <rbergeron> time
19:11:23 <gregdek> Yespls.
19:11:30 <rbergeron> kk, doing that now
19:11:52 <gundalow> Have we had any feedback on https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-october-2016
19:12:18 * gundalow can't remember from SanFran when we started to add extra things to the agenda
19:12:34 <rbergeron> okay, done
19:13:22 <rbergeron> gundalow: dunno. i will look tomorrow to determine such things, but there are some adds, yes. and i have a few to make after corralling some of the zuul / fedora / etc. humans of kindness
19:13:48 <gundalow> cool :)
19:13:56 <gundalow> what's already there good good
19:14:17 <rbergeron> gregdek: next?
19:14:32 <rbergeron> gundalow: good good?
19:14:38 <rbergeron> or look good? either way... yes? :)
19:14:41 <gundalow> ffs
19:14:43 <gregdek> Yep, next
19:14:46 <gundalow> what's already there looks good
19:15:08 <gundalow> (I think my brain went offline a few hours ago)
19:15:12 <gregdek> #topic Public metrics
19:15:21 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/38
19:15:33 <rbergeron> gundalow: mine too, i started at like 2am this morning :\
19:16:03 <gundalow> rbergeron: you should get that fixed
19:16:09 <gregdek> My take on this: if we want to move it forward, I think we just need to say "this is the data we think is important to measure community performance" and make sure it's being collected and measured -- and we also need to decide if that's the community team's remit or the core team's remit.
19:16:30 <gundalow> or script the collection so it happens automagically
19:16:35 <rbergeron> gregdek: ack
19:17:01 <gregdek> gundalow: yes, that bit is obvious -- but right now we're collecting lots of data, and we're not really being crisp about which, or why.
19:17:29 <gundalow> where is that data stored?
19:17:31 <gregdek> The core team continues to build capacity, and I think it's time to hand this off and be in a more advisory role.
19:17:53 <gregdek> gundalow: mostly google, iirc. I think it's using the google api for github data.
19:18:10 <gregdek> jtanner has more info.
19:18:15 <gundalow> ah, cool
19:18:17 <rbergeron> gundalow: that is one of the things to understand more, also :)
19:18:45 <rbergeron> data without visibility is like.. i don't know. unicorns without cheeseburgers. or something
19:18:50 * gundalow finds https://jctanner.github.io/ I've only seen sub pages befor
19:18:53 <gundalow> e
19:19:04 * gundalow hugs rbergeron
19:19:16 <gundalow> Poke it at Jason?
19:19:32 <gundalow> (stats collection or unicorns, you can decide)
19:20:05 <rbergeron> gundalow: that's already happened, but hard to be like "that's important!" without ... those reasons
19:20:09 <rbergeron> written somewhere
19:20:23 <gregdek> So.
19:20:24 <rbergeron> or the goals
19:20:28 <rbergeron> etc.
19:20:41 <gregdek> This is probably a question for newtMcKerr.
19:20:42 <gundalow> Plan, Do, Check, Adjust
19:21:30 <gregdek> Unless there are specific metrics we think newtMcKerr and team are missing, I think this is his ball.
19:22:13 <newtMcKerr> catching up, yes. We’re collecting a lot of data, but we haven’t really narrowed much to analysis state yet.  We’ve got work to do there.
19:22:47 <gregdek> OK, so that being the case, I think we're really advisory at this point. I think we'll have much more to say when we get to the fabled Module Split.
19:23:03 <gregdek> So I'm gonna put this one in the parking lot. Any objection?
19:23:08 <rbergeron> park it!
19:23:46 <gregdek> Done.
19:23:47 <gregdek> Next topic:
19:23:54 <gregdek> #topic Ansible Durham Meetup
19:24:02 <gregdek> Finally scheduled for October 5: https://www.meetup.com/Ansible-Durham/events/234298419/
19:24:09 <rbergeron> yay!
19:24:13 <gregdek> So I've closed that ticket.
19:24:26 <rbergeron> I'd come but i'll be in berlin and stuff :)
19:24:31 <rbergeron> also it's across the country
19:24:40 <gregdek> Yeah. :)
19:24:47 <gundalow> rbergeron: Are you staying in EMEA, or bouncing back between the two events?
19:25:03 <rbergeron> but y'all have fun!
19:25:05 <rbergeron> which two events?
19:25:40 * rbergeron goes to portland next week for automacon, then berlin for linuxcon, then ny for ansiblefest, then home, then openstack summit in barcelona
19:25:57 <gundalow> ah, OK
19:26:21 <gundalow> busy Robyn :)
19:26:48 * gundalow may be off to O'Reilly Velocity
19:26:49 <rbergeron> gundalow: yeah.
19:26:57 <gregdek> OK, that's all the opens.
19:27:13 <gregdek> We've got some stuff in backlog, but I need to cut short this week if we can.
19:27:18 <gregdek> So back to open floor for a bit:
19:27:21 <gregdek> #topic Open Floor
19:27:27 <gundalow> Nothing else from me
19:27:28 <rbergeron> gundalow: we may be in need of more ansible-y humans on hand in barcelona for openstack summit (or for vmworld the previous week in barcelona)
19:27:39 <rbergeron> carrie mentioned that to me yesterday
19:28:22 <gundalow> Carrie ping an email to the EMEA based people with the events in
19:30:03 <gundalow> Testing Working Group is going well, will pick up in speed after 2.2 is done
19:30:22 <gregdek> Excellent. Got to get that beast out the door :)
19:31:05 <gundalow> in particular once I've spoken Scot (docs) about chopping up developing_ansible_modules, he's already got some stuff moving there
19:31:49 <gregdek> Yeah, I saw some of that. Great!
19:32:19 * misc will be at the simmit
19:32:22 <misc> summit

19:33:54 <rbergeron> openstack? ansible contributor?
19:33:58 <rbergeron> someothersummit?
19:34:21 <rbergeron> misc: also, HI :)
19:34:45 <misc> rbergeron: openstack

19:35:13 <rbergeron> misc: that's what i thought. well, it will be great for ME to see you, and i will bring the hugs from gregdek :)
19:35:23 <rbergeron> misc: indeed
