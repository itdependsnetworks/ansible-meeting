  * Shippable has been having issues with their infrastructure the past
    week or so, but they've got some fixes in place now and more coming
    soon.  (gundalow, 17:12:23)
  * GitHub has been having some issues as well. Both (Shippable &
    GitHub) have contributed to larger than normal backlog for CI.

  * Gundalow: once I've got different parts of dev_guide/ updated I plan
    on linking to the docs in error messages. e.g. validate-modules
    links to how to document you module if that set of tests fail
    (gundalow, 17:15:32)
  * If you're iterating on a PR using CI, particularly for the "other"
    tests (sanity, compile), consider running those tests locally.
