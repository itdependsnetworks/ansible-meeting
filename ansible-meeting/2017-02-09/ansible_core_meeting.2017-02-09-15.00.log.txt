15:01:11 <jtanner> hi
15:01:15 * mattclay waves
15:01:22 <nitzmahone> Yo
15:01:26 <shertel> Hi
15:01:41 <gundalow> #topic Discuss extending the module "shipit" workflow to non-modules
15:01:43 <gundalow> bcoca: you there?
15:02:01 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/150#issuecomment-277025899
15:02:13 <bcoca> no, im here
15:02:48 <gundalow> bcoca: I believe you had an action to create a spreadsheet, and give an update
15:02:52 <bcoca> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z-BfOkAaY60nYir6qx6L9yHMqcwT31UtrgaAFKnjH9w
15:02:57 <gundalow> Could you please #info the key points
15:02:59 <bcoca> ^ spreadsheet was created before that
15:03:12 <albertom> hi!
15:03:15 <bcoca> #info spreadsheet exists
15:03:19 <bcoca> #info votes being cast
15:03:51 <bcoca> its currently inventory plugins , module-utils is next, then will start by each plugin dir
15:04:03 <gundalow> Cool
15:04:24 <gundalow> I assume if there is anything we need to voteon you will poke us on Slack?
15:05:00 <bcoca> you have link, a few people have already voiced opinion
15:05:12 * gundalow is a solid +0 on it all
15:05:35 <bcoca> we just need to have meeting go over votes, ignore whatever ryan wants .. then add metadata to scripts
15:05:42 <bcoca> ^ possibly to config files also
15:05:42 <gundalow> Cool, should I m
15:05:45 <jtanner> lulz
15:05:45 <gundalow> :)
15:06:30 <gundalow> #action bcoca to organise vote for inventory plugins
15:06:33 <bcoca> abadger2000: how do we deal with adding 'python metadata to config files'?
15:07:56 * jtyr is here
15:08:20 <gundalow> hum, I guess Mr Badger isn't around, so I'll move onto the next topic
15:08:55 <gundalow> #action bcoca to speak with abadger2000 to find out howe we add python metadata to config files
15:08:58 <gundalow> Thanks
15:09:11 <gundalow> #topic ansible/ansible#19283 hosts module (for /etc/hosts)
15:09:17 <gundalow> jtyr: Right on time
15:09:21 <jtyr> ;o)
15:09:41 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/150#issuecomment-277028142
15:09:50 <jtyr> I fixed all "incompatibilities" since last time ... so it should be good to go ...
15:09:54 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19283
15:10:16 <jtyr> only bcoca and abadger2000 wanted to discuss if we even need such module ...
15:10:40 <gundalow> #info Imports have been moved to match "house style"
15:10:55 <jtyr> their argument is that it can be done by a role ... my argument is that everything can be done as a role ...
15:11:12 <bcoca> jtyr: not everything, you need base set of plugins, after that, most things can
15:11:27 <jtyr> bcoca: yes, you only need shell module ... ;o)
15:11:37 <bcoca> raw!
15:11:42 <jtyr> everything else can be done as role ... ;o)
15:11:56 <gundalow> For the purposes of keeping the meeting moving I'm going to call out in 5 minutes to see if we want to continue discussion
15:12:27 <allanice001> gundalow,  - last comment on that -
15:12:28 <allanice001> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19283#issuecomment-277007481
15:12:32 <gundalow> #info New module policy requires two(+) shipits
15:12:43 <allanice001> abadger mentioned it being rejected
15:12:54 <gundalow> oh, it got closed then reopened
15:13:23 <gundalow> Please vote +1/0/-1
15:13:34 <bcoca> -1
15:13:37 <jtyr> he just had to demonstrate his power to break my pride of PEP8 compliant code ...;o)
15:13:45 <jtyr> bcoca: ;o(
15:13:52 <allanice001> -1
15:13:56 <thaumos> imo, a module like this is redundant.   There's template or lineinfile (which I dread).
15:13:57 <thaumos> -1
15:14:00 <bcoca> jtyr: im against that standard, but i was overruled, once adopted ... we need to follow them
15:14:19 <gundalow> Please vote: jtanner mattclay nitzmahone shertel thaumos on if we should accept https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19283
15:14:27 <rcarrillocruz> -1, imho modules should be base building blocks, tthere are enough foundations to do this with a role and/or current modules
15:14:39 <bcoca> jtyr: but im also against pep8 'purity' as you well know
15:14:54 <jtyr> template or lineinfile doesn't validate IP addresses ...
15:15:04 <jtanner> -1 because i don't want to deal with all the tickets complaining about $ODDBALL_HOSTS _SCHEMA
15:15:06 <gundalow> For the purpose of this topic we are not discussing PEP8</chairing>
15:15:18 <bcoca> in defense of this module, we do have many that are similar and violate the simplicity overlap, the question is if we want to stop or continue that trend (i want to stop)
15:15:40 <gundalow> 5x-1
15:15:48 <mattclay> +0
15:16:07 <shertel> 0
15:16:12 <mattclay> I see a little benefit of the validation, but it's not much more than just template/lineinfile
15:16:27 <bcoca> we have ip filters that validate/convert
15:16:31 <nitzmahone> +0 (what mattclay said)
15:16:32 <jtyr> it's much simpler than inline ...
15:16:33 <jtanner> lineinfile suffices for 80% of /etc/hosts needs
15:16:35 <gundalow> +0 For teh points that jtanner said, though I think it has some use
15:16:37 <rcarrillocruz> +1 to the filter
15:16:40 <bcoca> we can add is_IP test if we really want
15:18:32 <jtyr> shell module can cover 100% of all other modules in Ansible .... it's stupid refusing module only because some more generic and less convenient module can do the same thing ...
15:19:04 <jtanner> don't we have some some sort of filter for IP now?
15:19:52 <jtyr> jtanner: there is no filter nor module_utils to validate IP ...
15:20:00 <albertom> +1 while line in file does the job, i etc_hosts saves me from the regex
15:20:15 <bcoca> jtanner: yes, we have ip filters, we might need an ip test
15:20:16 <jtyr> albertom: exactly!
15:20:34 <albertom> also +1 for the filters :)
15:20:43 <jtyr> I'm against using lineinfile actually ... it just creates mess! ... never use it!
15:21:07 <bcoca> i agree, replace is much better
15:21:12 <bcoca> but template!
15:21:27 <gundalow> Core has voted: 4x-1 3x+0
15:21:32 <jtyr> no templates for hosts file!
15:21:44 <gundalow> Community has voted: 2x+1
15:21:50 <jtyr> +1 from me as well
15:21:53 <akasivel> I template hosts and much prefer that
15:22:01 <gundalow> jtyr: I counted you :)
15:22:03 <albertom> lol are you allowed to vote for yourself?
15:22:09 <bcoca> albertom: yes
15:22:17 <bcoca> its actually implied
15:22:20 <jtyr> akasivel: with this module you don;'t have to create the template file ...
15:22:27 <gundalow> though if jtyr voted -1, we move onto the next topic :)
15:22:40 <thaumos> of course!  I'm sure there were multiple votes by a single president recently.
15:22:49 <rcarrillocruz> lol
15:22:57 <akasivel> I don't believe it necessary and I personally wouldn't use it. -1 from me
15:23:27 <gundalow> OK, we we are not accepting it
15:23:44 <gundalow> So the question now is: Would a filter be useful?
15:23:58 <jtyr> using etc_hosts module is less work than using template module + template file ... what's so difficult to understand on that?
15:24:46 <albertom> if you use ansible to manage lots of machines, you want all of the to have the same config so template would do, etc_hosts only has value when you want to add/remove entries to an already customized /etc/hosts
15:24:57 <akasivel> My opinion is it recommends poor practice, of not managing the file as a whole.  The same problems I generally have with lineinfile and replace for that matter
15:25:26 <gundalow> So their is nothing to stop you using the module yourself
15:25:49 <shertel> not too familiar with our filters but does https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/4a57cba86d7de89aaae03e78ee5d4d87be79518e/lib/ansible/plugins/filter/ipaddr.py basically do what we need?
15:25:53 <gundalow> or putting it in Galaxy
15:25:55 <bcoca> akasivel: i dont disagree, this is where jtyr has a point (not the shell reductionist thing) in that we already have modules with lower bar, i just want to raise that bar
15:26:06 <akasivel> I also don't recommend complicated or heavily populated hosts files.  Use DNS
15:26:16 <jtanner> ^ i wish
15:26:44 <akasivel> new Ansible dev motto "raise the bar!"
15:26:53 <gundalow> For the purpose of keeping the meeting moving I'm moving onto the next topic at :30 as I don't believe we are getting anywhere
15:26:58 <jtanner> "lower the foo" ?
15:27:12 <gundalow> Though I'm happy if people think we *should* continue, just say
15:27:29 <albertom> I have a PR on my own :)
15:27:38 <jtyr> etc_hosts module is great for development if you just want to add few hosts and then forget about it ... then it's simpler to use one module only than the template module and have to create template file ...
15:27:41 <bcoca> jtyr: i do think your module is useful and plenty of people will want it, i just want to reduce the crazyness in ansible/ansible
15:27:44 <akasivel> gundalow lets move
15:27:50 <gundalow> akasivel: Thanks
15:28:05 <allanice001> +1 to moving along
15:28:31 <jtyr> bcoca: let the community to support that module and you have no additional work ...
15:28:45 <bcoca> jtyr: you can distribute it through galaxy in role for now, i'm working on making it easier to install/share custom plugins w/o having to put in ansible/ansible
15:28:58 <gundalow> #info Although we have modules that are aren't as good we are continually learning from what we've done in the past and trying to raise the bar
15:28:59 <abadger2000> buenos dias
15:29:01 <albertom> bcoca: thats nice
15:29:10 <bcoca> jtyr: in a perfect world, sadly people expect us to support everything in asnible/ansible .. that is not scalable
15:29:12 <jtyr> shame on all of you who voted -1 or 0! ... ;o)
15:29:15 <gundalow> #info [15:28] <@bcoca> jtyr: you can distribute it through galaxy in role for now, i'm working on making it easier to install/share custom plugins w/o having to put in ansible/ansible
15:29:41 <bcoca> jtyr: im ashamed of many things (writing php, vb, etc) but not of this
15:29:45 <albertom> abadger2000: que tal bien hombre?
15:29:55 <rcarrillocruz> vb!
15:29:57 <gundalow> ok, I'm moving on

15:32:24 <gundalow> abadger2000: noted
15:32:28 <jtyr> abadger2000: thanks! ;o)
15:32:29 <jimi|ansible> looking
15:32:54 <bcoca> jimi|ansible: issue is not as much the problem as the implication of what is inhertited and what isnt
15:32:58 <bcoca> ^ ticket
15:33:06 <jimi|ansible> actually bcoca, you don't know if the include is dynamic in the preprocess either
15:33:09 <bcoca> we dont have clear rules or docs
15:33:15 <jimi|ansible> has to be caught in helpers.py
15:33:37 <bcoca> ^ i was including helpers as 'preprocess'
15:33:51 <bcoca> as in, they happen on 'compile time' vs 'runtime'
15:33:51 <jimi|ansible> i haven't read jtyr's proposal, but to me the notify statements should be inherited
15:34:03 <gundalow> #info issue is not as much the problem as the implication of what is inhertited and what isnt
15:34:17 <gundalow> #info we dont have clear rules or docs
15:34:19 <bcoca> jimi|ansible: the  underlying issue is we dont have clear list of what does get inherited or not (i agree on notify)
15:34:37 <jimi|ansible> either that, or helpers.py should send the notification if it's brought in statically
15:34:41 <bcoca> imo everything not 'consumed' should be inhertited
15:34:54 <jimi|ansible> i believe it triggers the notification when dynamic?
15:35:04 <gundalow> So is it a document then add tests to ensure (and defend) that is the case?
15:35:11 <bcoca> jimi|ansible: it would if changed_when
15:35:20 <bcoca> includes, by nature, dont return changed
15:35:28 <jimi|ansible> ok, so two bugs then
15:35:42 <bcoca> yes, for that ticket, but what i wanted to discuss was the deeper issue
15:36:19 <bcoca> that ticket just shows one of many examples in which inheritance is not clearly defined
15:36:43 <jimi|ansible> that's because really there's only two things that are inherited from roles and includes - tags and conditionals
15:36:57 <jimi|ansible> and variables
15:37:11 <jimi|ansible> so three things :)
15:37:27 <bcoca> when
15:37:43 <bcoca> but does it also inherit change_when/failed_when?
15:37:50 <bcoca> loops are 'inherited' when static
15:38:14 <bcoca> become?
15:38:17 <bcoca> remote_user?
15:38:30 <bcoca> ^ tons of properties we need to a) decide, b)test/fix
15:38:56 <bcoca> it also affects blocks
15:39:17 <bcoca> role/include/blocks when run 'statically' (in case of blocks this is always)
15:39:29 <jimi|ansible> everything inherits, unless explicitly set not to
15:39:57 <bcoca> ok, aside from 'name' what do we explicitly set not to?
15:39:59 <jimi|ansible> really those 3 things above are special cases of inheritence
15:40:04 <jimi|ansible> vars
15:40:15 <bcoca> well, there is 'overwrite' and there is 'merge', those 3 are merge
15:40:31 <jimi|ansible> right, but i think they're explicitly set not to inherit, as we merge them specially
15:40:52 <bcoca> so 3 categoreies: inherited/inherited merge/not inherited
15:41:15 <bcoca> ^ we should have table documenting this and then make sure its true (as it seemed not to be with notify)
15:41:26 <bcoca> ^ also, notify should be 'merged' imo
15:41:49 <jimi|ansible> well, this goes towards us actually documenting playbook language
15:41:51 <bcoca> http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_directives.html <= fullest list i have
15:41:53 <jimi|ansible> which we hadn't really done
15:42:08 <jimi|ansible> yeah there's that list, but it doesn't really show what any of them do or how the inheritence works
15:42:27 <bcoca> which is why i added this topic to meeting
15:42:30 <bcoca> that is starting point
15:44:35 <abadger2000> I'm +1 to documenting things like this.... can't help, though, I haven't the foggiest what it's supposed to be.
15:45:00 <bcoca> well, that is first question, and i think we mostly agreed 'as much as possible/sane is inheritable'
15:45:29 <bcoca> then we need to deal with 'mergable' which includes the 3 above, i would add notify to that
15:45:41 <bcoca> basically anything that is a list ?
15:45:50 <bcoca> ^ tags/conditionals/notify
15:46:15 <bcoca> hmm, until?
15:46:26 <bcoca> delegate_to?
15:46:50 <bcoca> environment
15:49:09 <alikins> I would like to see a way to print/dump the info (it's attributes and structure) of a loaded playbook. More or less playbook repr's. To help debug/troubleshoot inheritance
15:49:09 <gundalow> Are we OK to move on then we can continue at the end. It seems to mainly be a topic for the Core Team and we have other things to cover
15:49:12 <jimi|ansible> there's a flag on the param as to whether it should be merged or not
15:49:33 <jimi|ansible> but yeah, i think we can move on, that issue should probably be re-opened and we need another issue for documenting
15:50:29 <gundalow> jimi|ansible: Thanks
15:51:05 <bcoca> alikins: hacking/ has script that generates that doc page, mostly by dumping the object structure

15:57:28 <albertom> hi
15:57:38 <gundalow> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20834
15:57:49 <gundalow> albertom: How can we help
15:57:54 <albertom> So swupd is the "update manager" for the ClearLinux OS
15:58:09 <albertom> i would like to have ansible support ClearLinux better
15:58:40 <albertom> A patch to detect the OS and select "swupd" as a package manager is already in place
15:58:44 <albertom> i mean merged
15:58:58 <albertom> only the swupd plugin is missing from ansible/ansible
15:59:03 <bcoca> -1 to new package managers +1 to suporting distros +1 to suppress my hatred of  yet anothe package manager
15:59:44 <albertom> yea it doesnt manage packages but bundles =/
15:59:52 <jtyr> albertom: bcoca will give you -1 because he can see my fingerprints all over your code ... ;o)))
16:00:01 <bcoca> -1 for semantic game!
16:00:10 <jtyr> as I said! ... ;o)
16:00:24 <jtyr> no new packages allower in Ansible ... all must be as a role since now on ... ;o)
16:00:35 <bcoca> jtyr: i dont have anything against your code, its actually pretty clean, its the overlap in utility
16:00:48 <jtyr> bcoca alias The Module Killer ... ;o)
16:00:49 <bcoca> jtyr: its not in ansible, its no new package managers in world
16:01:01 * bcoca is still goign to have to write ansible-installer  ... ironically
16:01:16 <bcoca> +1 to merge in concept, have not reviewed PR
16:01:29 <gundalow> bcoca: Do you have time to review?
16:01:34 <albertom> is there a chance this can be merged for 2.3 ?
16:01:40 <bcoca> mebbe
16:01:45 <gundalow> Getting fairly close to the 2.3 deadline, which is 15th Feb
16:02:37 <albertom> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils/facts.py#L159
16:02:53 <bcoca> content_url?
16:03:04 <gundalow> #action bcoca (if he has time) to review the code. albertom knows we are close to the 2.3 cut off, so we can't guarantee it will make it in for 2.3
16:03:11 <bcoca> manifest?
16:03:26 <bcoca> ^ i know nothing of swpd itself
16:03:57 <albertom> it would be a shame to have facter say use swupd module but no swupd module could be found :)
16:04:22 <bcoca> albertom: sadly we already do that as we can detect more pkgmgrs than we actually support
16:04:28 <bcoca> same with init systems
16:04:54 <bcoca> and im not against mergin new package manager module (im against new package managers existing at all)
16:05:05 <albertom> bcoca: i know swupd is "different"
16:05:12 <albertom> beggining in the way that it does not manage packages
16:05:19 <albertom> but collections of packages (bundles)
16:05:30 <albertom> you can try "docker run -ti clearlinux"
16:05:33 <albertom> im also in #clearlinux
16:05:56 <bcoca> just need to figure out the concepts and see how they align with UI
16:06:40 <albertom> I think the aliases are self explanatory
16:07:00 <albertom> manifest = version
16:07:11 <bcoca> see, that was totally not what i infered
16:07:12 <albertom> bundle = ~package
16:07:21 <bcoca> so im going to disagree with 'self explanatory'
16:07:41 <bcoca> it 'might be' to someone familiar with swupd already
16:07:48 <albertom> im a clearlinux dev so im clearly biased (no pun intended)
16:08:03 <abadger2000> bcoca: take heart, it's the opposite of yum/dnf.... seems that here, groups are first class citizens and packages are just a piece of implementation ;-)
16:08:31 <bcoca> i got that with bundle, manfiest seems confusing , no clue what content_url is/does
16:09:43 <albertom> normally you dont specify the urls so swupd gets the updates from clearlinux.org
16:09:55 <bcoca> albertom: im not saying its not OK, just need to figure what each thing is, manifest=version helps as i was totally expecting something else
16:09:58 <albertom> but if you have your custom swupd server (or mixer (i know))
16:10:07 <albertom> you can tell swupd to get the updates from another place
16:10:12 <bcoca> ^ it would help having that in descriptions
16:10:21 <ryansb> more docs more better
16:10:23 <albertom> manifest is the list of files that certain bundle contains at certain version
16:10:30 <albertom> so manifest ~= version
16:11:02 <albertom> leave comments for unclear descriptions and i;ll update with better descriptions today
16:11:16 <alikins> not having looked at any of the details, that vaguely reminds me of conary
16:11:27 <bcoca> manifest and content_url, update those with what you explained here and i think we are g2go
16:11:41 <bcoca> alikins: it is similar at first view
16:12:09 <abadger2000> contenturl sounds like other package manager's repository.
16:13:01 <allanice001> contenturl Could be a custom bundle location, or a mirror location, from what I can see
16:13:08 <albertom> yea, there is no repos... you get all form one source or nothing
16:13:32 <abadger2000> so what's the difference between name and content_url?
16:13:40 <albertom> name = bundle
16:13:49 <albertom> bundle is for example
16:13:51 <albertom> c-basic
16:14:01 <albertom> which contains all neccesary packages required to develop c programs
16:14:09 <bcoca> abadger2000: content_url ~= ppa location
16:14:10 <albertom> you cannot install just gcc
16:14:27 <albertom> content_url ~= mirror
16:14:39 <allanice001> I get it
16:14:39 <albertom> as i said, you get everything from one source or nothing
16:14:56 <alikins> (or looking closer, vaguely like ostree/atomic)
16:15:00 <abadger2000> a ppa location is a repository
16:15:01 <bcoca> repo url, but more limiting
16:15:01 <allanice001> For c-basic, you need example gcc, make, and a few more
16:15:50 <allanice001> name = c-basic; content-url=https://some.location.com/c-basic.bundle if you want to use custom location
16:15:53 <abadger2000> albertom: it's still counding like a reository to me... but with the caveat that inside of one transaction, there can only be a single repository.
16:15:57 <abadger2000> Is that accurate?
16:16:02 <bcoca> albertom: pr looks fine, i advise updating description to clarify concepts for those not familiar with clearos, but im not going to requrie for merge, abadger2000, alikins if you guys want to review code also?
16:16:51 <albertom> Ill update descriptions and ping you at #ansible-devel
16:17:12 <alikins> I'll take a look, albeit with 0 clearlinux experience
16:17:14 <albertom> in a few hours, i need to drive to the office after this meeting
16:17:26 <abadger2000> k
16:18:05 <allanice001> technically, the meeting is overrunning, but all in a day's work
16:18:15 <allanice001> No rest for the mighty gundalow
16:18:22 <gundalow> #action albertom to review feedback from meeting, continue discussion in #ansible-devel
16:18:33 <gundalow> allanice001: no rest for the wicked :)
16:18:42 <bcoca> alikins: as long as code and iface look good, i think we can trust albertom to have tested on clearos
16:18:43 <allanice001> :D
16:18:57 <gundalow> #topic ansible/ansible#20703 Fixing broken bind mount on CentOS
16:18:59 <bcoca> commands seem to match man page
16:19:04 <gundalow> jtyr: You still their?
16:19:07 <gundalow> there
16:19:08 <gundalow> here
16:19:11 <bcoca> somehwer?
16:19:32 * gundalow stops before breaking out into Celine Dion
16:19:32 <abadger2000> I think we sorted the need for meeting in #ansible-devel
16:19:41 <abadger2000> We can keep it on the agenda to make sure it gets merged.
16:19:45 <gundalow> should really see a doctor about that
16:19:53 <gundalow> abadger2000: oh, OK
16:20:10 <gundalow> #info believe most issues have been resolved. Revisit next week to ensure it's merged
16:20:45 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:20:55 <gundalow> So reviewing the agenda, the other things are
16:21:54 <gundalow> #topic ansible/ansible#13206 Allow specifying Vault password from the environment
16:22:02 <gundalow> Appologies, I missed one
16:22:04 <gundalow> mattclay:
16:22:26 <gundalow> What's needed to progress this?
16:22:42 <gundalow> agreeding a way forward?
16:22:59 <mattclay> I think we just need votes from people who weren't participating in the discussion on Slack.
16:23:42 <mattclay> Well, I guess votes from everyone, since I didn't make a note of the votes we did have.
16:23:55 <gundalow> What are the options we are voting on?
16:24:40 <mattclay> Accept or reject the PR to allow setting the vault password from an env var. If accept, I believe we were all in agreement that a runtime warning was needed.
16:25:11 <ryansb> I'm ok with it, since env vars are a common way for CI/CD systems to expose secrets
16:25:37 <allanice001> +1 with runtime warning
16:25:47 <bcoca> -1 cause then we also have to add connection and becoem passwords as envronment variables to keep 'parity'
16:26:08 <bcoca> aside from generally bad usage of secrets in env vars
16:26:24 <mattclay> Also, the runtime warning was suggested to not be able to be disabled.
16:26:35 <gundalow> Is their anything we need to do to avoid passwords being leaked? Do we ever print env?
16:26:44 <bcoca> ansible_env
16:27:10 <abadger2000> what's the hierarchy of security?
16:27:22 <gundalow> abadger2000: in what sense?
16:27:35 <gundalow> #info Main question is do we allow or not
16:27:59 <abadger2000> files are best to store secrets that have to be persisted, followed by env vars (not all systems make env vars secrure), and then never use the CLI?
16:28:11 <abadger2000> because CLI is almost never secure
16:28:12 <bcoca> abadger2000: basically
16:28:15 <gundalow> #info Discussion that a runtime warning is needed if this feature is used (most seem to agreed, needs vote)
16:28:25 <bcoca> -1 to feature at all
16:28:46 <bcoca> specially since we dont do this for the other secrets, once we introduce 1 we'll have to add the others
16:28:48 <allanice001> Perhaps also add a step :: os.environ["ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD"] = ""
16:28:56 <abadger2000> so it's a question of whether we go from something that we know can be secured everywhere to allowing something that can be secured some places...
16:29:03 <gundalow> #info If implemented maybe make it impossible for the warning to be disabled
16:29:36 <ryansb> +1 on feature and warning (ambivalent on making runtime warning un-disable-able)
16:29:44 <gundalow> allanice001: That's a cool idea
16:29:46 <bcoca> ^ someone wil ask for removal and that decision might be revoked, i dont consider that a 'softening'
16:30:05 <abadger2000> Since it's entirely our stuff (not working with an external library/toolset like modules do) I err on the side of security here.
16:30:08 <abadger2000> -1
16:30:29 <gundalow> #info < allanice001> Perhaps also add a step :: os.environ["ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD"] = "". This would may help avoid teh password being leaked
16:31:14 <mattclay> +1 -- I'm actually at +0.5 I think, but I'll stick to round numbers. :)
16:31:33 <abadger2000> gundalow: race condition.
16:31:35 <ryansb> mattclay: votes are ints, sorry
16:31:54 <abadger2000> gundalow: also.... how are they sticking it into the environment?
16:32:02 <allanice001> Change my vote to +1 with un-disableable warning and cleanup step if implemented
16:32:28 <bcoca> there is no way to make the warning 'permanently undisableable'
16:32:28 <abadger2000> If they're only sticking it into the environment for running ansible, that's fine... if it's in a login script or something then we can't clear the password from every other program.
16:32:42 <gundalow> #info [16:32] < abadger2000> If they're only sticking it into the environment for running ansible, that's fine... if it's in a login script or something then we can't clear the password from every other program.
16:32:44 <allanice001> But I also see how this would open the gates for other avenues of passwords being env's being set
16:32:51 <mattclay> abadger2000: This is for use with CI systems, where CI has already placed it in the env.
16:33:11 <gundalow> #!/bin/sh
16:33:12 <gundalow> echo $ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD
16:33:17 <bcoca> mattclay: and there is already clear workaround, external to ansible, i dont think we need to add it inline
16:33:19 <gundalow> ansible-playbook --vault-password-file /path/to/vault_from_env.sh ...
16:33:19 <gundalow> ￼￼ 1￼
16:33:24 <abadger2000> mattclay: but we're not going to do a test and say, oh, you're running on travis-ci.org, we'll look for this environment variable...
16:33:31 <gundalow> mattclay: Would the above be fine with CI?
16:33:31 <abadger2000> It's a genewral feature and as such can be abused.
16:33:35 <ryansb> abadger2000: but if they put it in a login script, I don't see how that's Ansible's issue
16:33:49 <nitzmahone> abadger2000: yeah, that's the point (and contention, I think)- the feature *could* be misused in a way that would expose their vault password, though so could the current impl.
16:33:50 <abadger2000> ryansb: we create a feature that allows it.
16:33:54 <bcoca> ryansb: they can use now w/o ansible having to support/secure it
16:33:59 <gundalow> oh and chmod +x /path/to/vault_from_env.sh
16:34:01 <ryansb> Everything *can* be used wrong/insecurely though. We let file delete things
16:34:01 <abadger2000> ryansb: when it' unnecessary to create the feature at all.
16:34:01 <mattclay> abadger2000: Correct. I was just pointing out what the use case was.
16:34:15 <abadger2000> "Make easy things easy and hard things possible"..... securtity is a hard thing.
16:34:20 <nitzmahone> But there's no *clean* way to do it for stuff like Travis where you can't easily/securely place a file.
16:34:41 <bcoca> nitzmahone: that does not mean we should also 'dirty' ansible handling of secrets
16:34:42 <allanice001> There are alternatives nitzmahone
16:34:46 <abadger2000> so if the user has to create a shell script to make this possible... it's possible which I think is fine.
16:35:09 <abadger2000> It's even relatively simple for a security matter.
16:35:21 <nitzmahone> I do agree w/ bcoca in that if we do it for vault, others are sure to follow
16:35:21 <bcoca> this feature is NOT a requirement for CI to work, as there is clear alternative in ticket
16:35:25 <ryansb> Yeah, fair. It's a 1 line shell script
16:35:29 <abadger2000> not like having to create a new ssl CA cert and install it on your system, for instance.
16:35:31 <mattclay> gundalow: Having an executable script to echo the env var works, it's just extra steps. Both were already mentioned on the PR.
16:35:51 <gundalow> mattclay: yup, I was wondering what the PR gives us over that
16:36:06 <bcoca> gundalow: 1 less file
16:36:15 <allanice001> https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/private-dependencies/
16:36:18 <gundalow> If you are already doing stuff with ENV then you are already having to do some changes
16:36:44 <bcoca> i see many drawbacks for little reward
16:36:53 <alikins> I have an old branch that starts generalizing the mechanism for vault 'secrets' a bit at https://github.com/ansible/ansible/compare/devel...alikins:vaults_secrets_more
16:37:04 <gundalow> This doesn't seem to be a case of zero to five steps (e.g it doesn't work out the box)
16:37:07 <gundalow> -1
16:37:15 <bcoca> alikins: that is not only problem, once we accept 1 secret as envvar it wont make sense we dont accept all
16:37:35 <allanice001> Agree with bcoca here
16:38:05 <bcoca> for me its clear, there is trivial workaround, this opens several cans of worms we dont really need to deal with
16:38:15 <gundalow> bcoca: +1
16:38:41 <ryansb> alright, sounds like a decision, I count -4 +2
16:38:58 <ryansb> or +1.5 if we allow `float` votes
16:39:06 <gundalow> #agreed Rejected, use work around
16:39:24 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:39:31 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:39:43 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/152
16:39:55 <bcoca> ^ but we can punt till next week, late already
16:40:06 <bcoca> nitzmahone:  ^ you might want to red taht
16:40:15 <nitzmahone> Yeah, I did
16:40:35 <gundalow> nitzmahone: You want to talk about that now or next week?
16:40:38 <gundalow> (or never)
16:40:45 <nitzmahone> Nah, next week or offline is fine
16:40:49 * gundalow hides fro Mr Wieers
16:40:57 <gundalow> Cool
16:41:04 <gundalow> Closing shortly
16:41:12 <allanice001> Nothing should prevent community from having these in ansible-devel
16:41:43 <allanice001> just my 5 cents
16:41:56 <gundalow> +1
16:42:35 <ryansb> back in my day it was only 2 cents
16:42:51 <gundalow> jimi|ansible: Testing Working Group starts in 15 mins, so I'm not sure if you want to continue your chat in #ansible-devel or Slack (it seemed to be mainly core people talking)
16:42:59 <allanice001> yeah, but with the exchange rate ......
16:43:24 <gundalow> penny for your thoughts, I'll give you my five cents
16:43:31 <gundalow> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand we are done
16:43:37 <gundalow> Thank you everyone
16:43:53 <gundalow> As always add stuff onto https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/150
