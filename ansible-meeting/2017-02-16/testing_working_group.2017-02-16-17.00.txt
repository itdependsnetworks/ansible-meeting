Meeting summary
---------------
* Agenda, as always https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/114
  (gundalow, 17:00:36)
* work continues on Network integration tests  (gundalow, 17:01:57)
* Test infrastructure has been stabilizing over the last week. Shippable
  will be deploying another release this weekend to resolve issues with
  webhook failures.  (mattclay, 17:02:50)
* ansible-test has been updated to handle changes to module_utils more
  efficiently, which should speed up CI on PRs which need to make
  module_utils changes.  (mattclay, 17:03:53)
* ansible-test to ignore file not in git ansible/ansible#20944
  (gundalow, 17:19:28)
  * LINK: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20944   (gundalow,
    17:19:43)
  * Not as simply as it first seems - PR only works for code-smell
    portion of sanity  (gundalow, 17:48:59)
  * The builtin target finders ('walk_sanity_targets for ex, iirc) need
    to be updated as well.  (gundalow, 17:49:22)
  * There's no `.git` directory on the "remote" instances when running
    ansible-test.  (gundalow, 17:49:33)
  * ACTION: mattclay To spend some time to write down the various issues
    around making this work, so we can do it for more than just
    code-smell.  (gundalow, 17:49:53)
  * The files to ignore could be anywhere in the directory tree
    (gundalow, 17:50:41)
