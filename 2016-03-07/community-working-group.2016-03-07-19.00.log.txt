19:00:36 <gregdek> Waiting on rbergeron to escape another meeting, so it'll be another 1/2hr before we start in earnest. In the meantime, happy to chat about anything anyone wants to bring up.
19:00:45 <gregdek> Reminder of our open task board:

19:01:06 <gregdek> ping if anyone has an issue they'd like to discuss.
19:01:18 <gregdek> otherwise, we'll dig in at :30 after.
19:01:38 <chouse> are you guys working on the new repo for proposals?
19:01:43 <gundalow> gregdek: What's the thoughts for "Testing Working Group"
19:01:58 <gregdek> gundalow: that we probably need one :)
19:02:26 <gregdek> We came away from the contributor summit convinced that we needed a working group to figure out testing issues.
19:02:38 <gregdek> Trouble is, I don't know that we came away with a clear mandate.
19:02:41 <gregdek> So we probably need:
19:02:45 <gregdek> * Someone to chair it;
19:03:03 <gundalow> gregdek: Good first step. I'm happy to help out a bit
19:03:05 <gregdek> * A regular time to commit to talking through the issues;
19:03:13 <gregdek> * A roadmap.
19:03:26 <gregdek> But step one is step one. I'll add you to the list of participants, thanks!
19:03:38 <gundalow> gregdek: Thanks, I'm bob-smith on github
19:04:06 <gundalow> I think we chatted briefly at AnsibleFest
19:04:26 <gregdek> Ah, great! I've added you to that ticket so we know to invite you to the kickoff, whenever it happens to be.
19:04:41 <gundalow> sweet
19:36:16 <gregdek> ok, I think we have a rbergeron :)

19:40:56 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/14
19:41:06 <gregdek> It's scheduled for the 29th, gathering speakers now.
19:41:22 <gregdek> #topic Open Source Galaxy
19:41:32 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/11
19:42:01 <rbergeron> hey, i'm getting somewhere with this after this meeting! for reals
19:42:08 <gregdek> chouse last comment was "do you need tech stuffs listed here"
19:42:21 <gregdek> And I think the answer is probably yes, we'll need the tech scoping here as well
19:42:45 <chouse> roger that
19:42:46 <gregdek> rbergeron has an "official" list that we can start from
19:42:53 <gregdek> And it may contain some of that
19:43:24 <rbergeron> it definitely has some of that.
19:43:32 <gregdek> #topic Job Description Developer Evangelist
19:43:41 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/33
19:43:53 <rbergeron> gregdek: I think ou set up time for us to work further on this later, yes?
19:43:55 <gregdek> #info First draft started and gregdek and rbergeron iterating
19:44:20 <rbergeron> oh, no, i'm crazy
19:44:23 <gregdek> Hoping to be done this week :)
19:44:27 <rbergeron> but i think we can draft something up quick :)
19:44:28 <gregdek> #info rbergeron is crazy!
19:44:33 <rbergeron> #undo
19:44:33 <zodbot> Removing item from minutes: INFO by gregdek at 19:44:28 : rbergeron is crazy!
19:44:36 <gregdek> aw man
19:44:50 <gregdek> #topic New Module Process
19:45:00 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/39
19:45:13 <gregdek> The big thing we need here is a commitment of time. That's really the most important thing.
19:45:33 <gundalow> Should we only accept new modules if they have tests (assuming they are safe to test)?
19:45:41 <gregdek> Tomorrow we meet with jmckerr to get that commitment.
19:45:48 <rbergeron> wednesday. :)
19:45:51 <gregdek> gundalow: in core, I believe we should. In extras, I don't believe we should.
19:46:00 <gregdek> (Right, Wednesday, thanks rbergeron)
19:46:05 <rbergeron> you're welcome!
19:46:06 <gundalow> because you think it will raise the bar to entry too high?
19:46:11 <gregdek> gundalow: yup.
19:46:12 <rbergeron> gundalow: precisely
19:46:27 <gregdek> But for core, I absolutely think we need to get there.
19:46:32 <gundalow> sure, makes sense
19:46:36 <gundalow> gregdek: YES
19:46:39 <rbergeron> and then there's not much incentive to "get better" afterwards :)
19:46:42 <gundalow> (IMHO)
19:46:53 <rbergeron> whereas a move from core to extras, or some other graduation policy, might provide incentive.
19:46:59 <gregdek> And it may be that we end up with a promotion process from extras to core that says "if you write tests, we'll consider your module for core, and if you don't, we won't."
19:47:03 <gregdek> But we're not quite there yet.
19:47:10 <gundalow> sounds sensible
19:47:31 <gregdek> I believe part of the testing working group will be to get those guidelines for core module testing in place. So stay tuned. :)
19:47:46 <gundalow> gregdek: :D
19:48:02 <gregdek> (I do know that one of the takeaways from the contributor summit was that bcoca was going to move module testing into the ansible core repo, so that should be happening soon-ish)
19:48:12 <gregdek> (Sorry, ansible-modules-core repo)
19:48:21 <gregdek> ok!
19:48:22 <rbergeron> probably once there is a group poking at him will be a good incentive for him to get that to happen :D
19:48:28 <gregdek> yup :)
19:48:33 <gundalow> MOTIVATION!
19:49:03 <bcoca> yes, soonish
19:49:23 <gregdek> #topic Code of Conduct update
19:49:26 <bcoca> but it was from ansible/ansible to ansible-modules-extras
19:49:37 <gregdek> Oh, ok, thx bcoca
19:49:40 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/40
19:49:44 <bcoca> ^ and still have it run from main and/or extras
19:50:13 <gregdek> It's become clear that our current code of conduct is a little light on specifics, and there are other codes of conduct in the open source world that provide better models.
19:50:18 <bcoca> after that we still need to decide if we merge or not modules-core and then it would make sense to move those tests or not (though more aciton plugins there)
19:50:40 <gregdek> Given some recent experiences, prudent to improve our CoC.
19:51:02 <gregdek> thx bcoca for that update
19:51:04 <bcoca> i think we've overblone that, just too used to people being nice
19:51:36 <gregdek> Well, we got away with it for quite a while. I think we've actually got one of the more civil communities I've seen -- but we need to be ready when people aren't nice.
19:51:44 <gregdek> So we will do that.
19:51:52 <rbergeron> and for a lot of people, if a sufficient code of conduct doesn't exist, they choose to not participate.
19:52:13 <bcoca> agreed, its needed, just didnt want it as a reaction
19:52:55 <gregdek> OK, that's it.
19:53:02 <gregdek> Today's business covered. :)
19:53:15 <rbergeron> good job!
19:53:19 <rbergeron> i aspire to get work done this week
19:53:28 <gregdek> And since we had 1/2hr of open floor, we don't need any more. :)
