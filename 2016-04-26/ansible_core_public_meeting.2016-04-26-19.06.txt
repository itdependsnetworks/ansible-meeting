Meeting summary
---------------
* Meeting agenda: https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/84
  (abadger1999, 19:07:31)
* https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/7 Proposal Auto-install
  roles  (abadger1999, 19:10:37)
  * ACTION: bcoca to make alternative or supplementary roles proposals
    to unblock  #7 Auto install ansible roles  (abadger1999, 19:45:29)

* Proposal: Re-run handlers option
  https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/9  (abadger1999, 19:46:01)
  * bcoca wonders if we can add the test.handlers information into the
    .retry file instead of having a separate file  (abadger1999,
    20:10:10)
  * sivel points out that the play could contain context that simply
    running the handlers won't have (ex: a play could use set_fact: and
    then fail.  I f the handler was run in the original it would have
    access to that fact. )  (abadger1999, 20:11:29)
  * sivel's use case is a play that: (1) tries to update an app (2) if
    that happens, then it performs checks (3) those checks are used to
    register vars (4) handlers then fire which make use of the
    registered vars.  Simply running handlers won't work in this
    instance.  (abadger1999, 20:14:00)
  * ACTION: bcoca to update the handlers ticket with proposed changes
    from the meeting.  (abadger1999, 20:22:22)

* Module names should be singular

  * LINK:

    (bcoca, 20:25:13)
  * ACTION: abadger1999 to change existing modules strategy to rename
    and alias  (abadger1999, 20:35:11)
  * ACTION: abadger1999 to add the singular module name rule to the
    module guidelines  (abadger1999, 20:35:32)

* open floor  (abadger1999, 20:35:58)

* Should we resurrect delegate_to as a var?  (abadger1999, 20:37:28)
  * ACTION: Decided that we're not bringing delegate_to back as a
    special task variable.  bcoca will update migration from 2.0 docs to
    mention it.  (abadger1999, 20:41:46)

* Open Floor  (abadger1999, 20:41:53)
  * py2.4 compat question was answered as we're only keeping python2.4
    compat for modules which do not have dependencies which require a
    higher version of python.  So things like docker_common.py are
    excluded from the python2.4 test in tests/utils/run_tests.sh
    (abadger1999, 20:45:16)

*   (abadger1999, 20:45:41)

* PRs are being accepted before all tests pass (see
  ansible/ansible#15586). How is this acceptable?  (abadger1999,
  20:45:47)
  * LINK: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/httpbin   (sivel, 20:51:40)
  * LINK: https://github.com/lgarron/badssl.com   (sivel, 20:51:42)
  * ACTION: alikins to look at pulling tests that hit flakey external
    web servers into tests against web servers setup inside the test.
    (abadger1999, 21:04:09)

* Open Floor  (abadger1999, 21:04:58)
