16:14:15 <akasurde> caphrim007, I am OK with change
16:14:19 <akasurde> *changes
16:14:27 <funzo> are you talking about persistent connections?
16:14:32 <caphrim007> funzo: yes
16:14:38 <funzo> you don't have to do anything
16:14:42 <funzo> it's just the plumbing
16:15:00 <caphrim007> it's a new type of plugin though?
16:15:09 <caphrim007> or thats what privateip said
16:15:41 <caphrim007> these https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/plugins/terminal
16:16:38 <funzo> ok, there is a change coming for 2.4
16:16:48 <caphrim007> and this https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/8f97aef1a365cbbbb822d6d09f96af17a076b295/lib/ansible/constants.py#L346
16:16:51 <funzo> ganeshrn: feel free to provide detail
16:17:33 <ganeshrn> caphrim007 there are changes going in persistent connection framework planned for 2.4
16:17:58 <funzo> ganeshrn: would you mind noting that we need detailed docs that describe the changes
16:18:06 <caphrim007> can you elaborate? i'm not sure what that means and if that's bad or good
16:18:21 <ganeshrn> we are moving towards jsonrpc based communication, going ahead terminals will be replaced by cliconf
16:18:48 <ganeshrn> it will add a api's layer over cli
16:19:09 <caphrim007> apis were just introduced in last release though?
16:19:15 <caphrim007> err, i mean terminal plugins
16:19:29 <caphrim007> so...this stuff is still unstable and i should wait?
16:20:10 <ganeshrn> caphrim007: yes...i suggest to wait till new changes are in
16:20:15 <caphrim007> k
16:20:38 <ganeshrn> funzo: I will work on getting it documented
16:20:48 <trishnag> ganeshrn: thanks for the detailed info.
