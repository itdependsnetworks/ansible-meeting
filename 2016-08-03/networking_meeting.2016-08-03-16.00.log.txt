16:04:08 <gundalow> #topic Networking Hub @ AnsibleFest SanFran
16:05:17 <caphrim007> @gundalow: I updated the gtm_datacenter pr
16:05:17 <gundalow> #info Peter and I ran the first "Networking Hub" day long event at San Fran last week where we had demos of the latest Networking modules. We also had VMware, Cisco, Cumulus and Arista there. Was very busy and really useful to see what people are using Ansible for
16:05:26 <gundalow> caphrim007: excellent
16:05:37 <caphrim007> it's ready afaik pending other reviews
16:06:01 <caphrim007> i'm not yet sold on the gtm facts module yet. it's giving me problems
16:06:16 <gundalow> #Network Hub will return at Brooklyn, Sign up is live https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest
16:06:31 <gundalow> #topic Module Reviews
16:06:56 <gundalow> #info gundalow is going to make an effort to stay on top of reviews and ensure the process is moving
16:07:36 <gundalow> #info If people see stuff getting stuck either ping me directly or add the module to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
16:07:58 <gundalow> caphrim007: ACK. Shout out if you need anything from me
16:08:16 <gundalow> Do we have anyone from F5 here?
16:08:27 <caphrim007> @gundalow I'm from F5
16:08:47 <caphrim007> we have a greater effort underway to re-do the existing modules too
16:09:08 <gundalow> duh, sorry, still trying to learn IRC, GitHub and realnames :)
16:09:09 <caphrim007> but i'm willing to let the other contributors PR's slide and then I'll redo them in the longer term
16:09:25 <gundalow> Peter said: F5 guys should be on to handle: ansible/ansible-modules-extras#554
16:09:28 <gundalow> ansible/ansible-modules-extras#1000
16:09:37 <caphrim007> yeah
16:10:09 <gundalow> cool
16:10:42 <caphrim007> 1000 is my pr, so it should be as f5-ish as you can get. 554 is a non-f5
16:10:53 <caphrim007> but i'm reviewing it in any case as I have the resources to do so
16:10:56 <gundalow> caphrim007: At somepoint I'll arrange a call with you guys and privateip just to introduce myself more formally and get a better understanding of where you are upto
16:11:04 <caphrim007> k
16:13:39 <gundalow> (was just updating agenda)
16:14:32 <gundalow> caphrim007: Not sure how I was looking at an out of date diff, I'll look again at https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/1000
16:14:53 <caphrim007> @gundalow I pushed an updated PR ~5/10 min ago
16:15:03 <gundalow> ah, OK
16:15:05 <gundalow> cool
16:15:12 <gundalow> #topic openfloor
16:15:18 <gundalow> Anyone got anythign else
16:15:27 <gundalow> What else would people like to see from this meeting?
16:15:41 <stianvi> anything in regards of #4104 ?
16:16:03 <gundalow> Enabling JSON for network/junos/junos_command.py ?
16:16:07 <stianvi> yaeh
16:16:16 <stianvi> ahh, it's a go? i.e. PRs that are close to being able to be merged:
16:16:41 <gundalow> Code looks good to me. I'm getting privateip to be the final gatekeeper before merging
16:16:45 <stianvi> ack
16:16:52 <stianvi> thanks
16:17:42 <gundalow> gregdek: process question. Do you think I should assign PRs to privateip that are good to merge
16:17:59 <gregdek> I would.
16:18:05 <gundalow> networking is a little different to Core as we currently use privateip as teh final sign off
16:18:09 <gundalow> cool
16:18:34 <gregdek> I mean, you're still putting things in "shipit" also, I assume?
16:19:06 <gundalow> I'm adding the word "shipit", do I need to do things with lables for ansible-modules-core/extra?
16:20:03 <gundalow> sivel: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/16434 I think that needs a rebase to fix Shippable
16:20:41 <gundalow> erm
16:20:49 <gundalow> stianvi: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/16434 I think that needs a rebase to fix Shippable
16:20:54 <stianvi> gundalow: ack, I'll fix it tomorrow
16:21:15 <gundalow> gregdek: do I need to manually add the label?
16:22:15 <gregdek> gundalow: yeah, but if you're assigning...
16:22:26 <gundalow> #topic extras/issues/2542 mikrotik routeros support
16:22:31 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/issues/2542
16:23:00 <gundalow> #info The Core team doesn't plan to add mikrotik routeros support, if someone else is interested they will need to add that
16:23:55 <gundalow> Just an FYI incase anyone else here has info
16:24:06 <gundalow> Just an FYI incase anyone else here has an interest
16:25:11 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
