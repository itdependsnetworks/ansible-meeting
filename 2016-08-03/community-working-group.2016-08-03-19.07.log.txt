19:08:16 * gundalow waves
19:08:34 <gregdek> Agenda, as always: https://waffle.io/ansible/community
19:09:19 <gregdek> #topic Contributor Conference
19:09:25 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/93
19:09:44 <gregdek> This is complete, and it was awesome, but we've got some follow-up stuff to do.
19:10:02 <gregdek> Need to send a summary and video links, so I've updated the issue to do that.
19:10:09 <gregdek> Anything else from that we need to do?
19:10:16 * rbergeron arrives
19:10:34 <gundalow> It's still on my list to review https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-july-2016-testing and create some tickets
19:10:47 <rbergeron> gregdek: i guess with the video links we need to download them and then upload them.
19:11:24 <rbergeron> gregdek: I think there was also a request for an ansible-container mailing list that we chatted about but i'm not sure if you mean "things we need to make tickets for from the f2f" or just "things we have to do relating to f2f logistics / ending / begin followup"
19:11:27 <gundalow> I've created the stub area (& added Brookyln) to https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/MEETINGS.md
19:11:45 <gregdek> Yep. We can do that this week, I guess -- did you do much editing before?
19:11:51 <gregdek> (re: videos)
19:12:00 <gundalow> Please trim the beginning/end
19:12:14 <gundalow> I ended up watching 20 minutes of people drinking coffee last time :P
19:12:17 <gregdek> LOL
19:12:21 <rbergeron> ot really -- I think at the beginning of one while we were just ... making sure it was all up and running I trimmed some stuff out.
19:12:25 <rbergeron> Or maybe I didn't.
19:12:27 <gregdek> Well, my video editing skills are not exactly 1337.
19:12:36 <jtanner> coffee drinking habits tell you a lot about a person
19:12:41 <gundalow> jtanner: :)
19:12:42 <gregdek> They do! I'm a slurper.
19:13:06 <rbergeron> gregdek: google makes it pretty easy though. but I need the files from your meeting thing. so maybe later you can tell me your password and i can grab them and download them and then ... upload them.
19:13:26 <gregdek> rbergeron: I'll take you up on that.
19:13:41 <gregdek> Rather than editing, if we can put index times in the description, that's probably ok.
19:13:51 <gundalow> gregdek: aye that would be fine
19:13:52 <rbergeron> gregdek: yeah.
19:13:53 <gregdek> (18:40, actual conference!)
19:14:17 <rbergeron> well, make a note of that :)
19:14:45 <rbergeron> for when we chat on le telefono later i guess
19:14:53 <gregdek> ...aaaaaaand now the question is, "what does the contributor summit for Brooklyn look like?"
19:15:06 <gregdek> Frankly, I wonder if we want a whole day for that so close on the heels of this one.
19:15:08 <jtanner> what do you mean?
19:15:23 <gregdek> jtanner: what do you mean what do I mean?
19:15:33 <gundalow> gregdek: Were there other things that didn't get discussed this time
19:15:34 <jtanner> you do you mean i mean you mean i mean
19:15:48 <gregdek> gundalow: we hit pretty much all the key topics.
19:16:17 <rbergeron> gregdek: so -- I know that in talking with mordred today that the zuul folks were targeting early october to have v3 things done and being ready to hae more srs discussions about how to move forward on the CI stuff
19:16:34 <gregdek> That's a good topic, yes.
19:16:44 <gundalow> How many different people on the East-siiiiiiiide do we expect to get in person that didn't turn up to San Fran
19:16:59 <gregdek> Won't know until we ask.
19:17:18 <gregdek> I mean, I suppose we just start the entire process again.
19:17:32 <gundalow> I think we should have at least 1/2day. A load of people will fly out for it, would be a shame not to get them involved. Also timeszones are a bit kinder to Europe
19:17:33 <gregdek> I know the CFP for AnsibleFest is already out...
19:17:54 <gregdek> Well, we don't have to make a call until we've got some proposals.
19:18:06 <gregdek> If people propose a bunch of topics, then we know we can fill more time.
19:18:16 * rbergeron nods
19:18:39 <gregdek> So I guess the answer is "time to create the tracking issue for the next Contributor Conference!" :)
19:19:03 <rbergeron> i'm glad your brain is on today. :)
19:19:06 <gundalow> and and create an empty eitherpad (and link that from the existing one & MEETINGS.md) and see what we get
19:19:12 * gundalow -> afk need tea
19:19:28 <gregdek> ...which is *eight weeks* from today.
19:19:30 <gregdek> Holy moly.
19:19:46 <gregdek> That is not. Enough. Time.
19:19:46 <rbergeron> yikes
19:19:49 <rbergeron> yeah.
19:19:53 <rbergeron> wait, is that right?
19:20:17 <rbergeron> 10 weeks?
19:20:22 <gregdek> Technically...
19:20:27 <gregdek> 9 1/2 weeks!
19:20:40 <rbergeron> lol
19:20:49 <gregdek> aaaanyway.
19:21:42 <rbergeron> yeah.
19:21:46 <rbergeron> i feel like ... man, that is soon
19:21:52 <rbergeron> but: I guess we can ask!
19:21:52 <gundalow> wow
19:22:25 * gundalow suggests pinging a poll for topics out to everyone and asking who would attend if we did one
19:22:40 <gregdek> Yeah.
19:22:49 <gregdek> Like, by next week at the very latest.
19:22:59 <gundalow> aye :(
19:23:09 <gregdek> ok!
19:23:13 <gregdek> Well, that's exciting!
19:23:30 <gundalow> I'll probs have only had 6-7 Testing Working Groups by then, but I guess we might have some decent progress with stuff
19:23:32 <gregdek> Anyway, we have an issue to track that: https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/115
19:23:40 <gundalow> cool
19:23:42 <gregdek> So let's move on.
19:23:43 <gregdek> :)
19:24:05 <gundalow> Oh, and for the record. Excellent work gregdek and rbergeron on Contributor Conference SanFran!
19:24:10 <gregdek> Aww, thanks! :)
19:24:18 <gregdek> #topic Module Maintainer Guidelines
19:24:19 <rbergeron> :) thanks, yo.
19:24:28 <rbergeron> oh, hey, this thing
19:24:29 * rbergeron moans
19:24:36 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/81
19:24:49 <gregdek> Got to get it merged, I think is all. Need some help with that?
19:25:42 <rbergeron> just with being reminded, i guess. I have the "i'm not getting on a plane thank god" thing covered for a while
19:25:51 * rbergeron sighs
19:26:14 <rbergeron> but: yeah, I can handle it for reals now
19:26:20 <gregdek> Did we agree on where it should land?
19:27:01 <rbergeron> extras/module-maintainers ?
19:27:05 <rbergeron> Is what it said
19:27:10 <gregdek> Yeah, I think that's right.
19:27:17 <gregdek> I mean, we have a MAINTAINERS.md file there already.
19:27:27 <gundalow> sure, it will end up in ansible/ansible later in the year/early nxt year anyways
19:27:37 <rbergeron> oh, wait
19:28:14 <rbergeron> well, I don't know. i think extras/module-maintainers.
19:28:29 <gundalow> BIKESHED
19:28:30 <gregdek> So I think we're actually talking about a PR to MAINTAINERS.md since it's got a similar structure?
19:28:42 <gregdek> Just replace the old with the new
19:28:43 <gregdek> ?
19:28:45 <gundalow> just wack it there, as long as it's been linked from sensible places & the bot
19:28:52 <gundalow> where is the existing one?
19:29:27 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/blob/devel/MAINTAINERS.md
19:30:25 <gundalow> ah, in the root. Sure put it there then more people will spot it by chance
19:30:36 <bcoca> .maintainers in each category and then inside each module
19:30:38 <gundalow> also that follows GitHub recomendations
19:30:49 <gregdek> It's now even more important because jtanner has his issue bot working, and he wants to refer to that file from the bot.
19:30:56 <gregdek> bcoca: what?
19:31:19 <jtanner> i can make the bot smarter though and also reference the names in the module files ... if that's what we want
19:31:34 <jtanner> or wherever
19:31:43 <bcoca> ansible-doc shows maintainers, but from authors field, it cannot rely on having git
19:31:48 <bcoca> so we should keep info in the modules
19:31:51 <jtanner> i suspected that to be a topic in the internal meeting next week
19:31:53 <gregdek> No, this is different.
19:31:55 <bcoca> also probably easier for bot
19:32:04 <rbergeron> that's a whole different topic
19:32:05 <gregdek> And actually, MAINTAINERS.md is currently misnamed, sigh
19:32:11 <gregdek> It should really be GUIDELINES.md
19:32:25 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/issues/19 tracks how to get authors
19:32:43 <gregdek> We don't really even want a "maintainers" file per se, because that's all run by Ansibullbot now and has been for quite some time.
19:32:44 <rbergeron> gregdek: why is it misnamed?
19:33:05 <gregdek> Because MAINTAINERS.md typically means "who's maintaining this stuff?" and not "how do we maintain stuff?"
19:33:08 <gregdek> I think.
19:33:36 <bcoca> ah, yes, confusing
19:34:00 <gregdek> Or CONTRIBUTING.md, actually
19:34:08 <bcoca> ^ was about to suggest that
19:34:10 <gregdek> TAXONOMIES ARE STUPID
19:34:13 <bcoca> guildines is too generic
19:34:17 * rbergeron runs out of palms for her face
19:34:22 <gregdek> LOL
19:34:23 <gregdek> :)
19:34:27 <bcoca> yes, but ... how do we understand each other if we don't classify what we talk about?
19:34:48 <gregdek> Everything devolves to Wittgenstein.
19:34:55 <rbergeron> I will stick it in contributing.md. Somehow.
19:35:15 <bcoca> git mv
19:35:18 <bcoca> simple change
19:35:22 <rbergeron> except that all those files throughout the ansible repo are exactly (hopefully) the same.
19:35:29 <bcoca> but need to make sure the 'exclusions' match the new names
19:35:43 <rbergeron> And it assumes that people have already this file we want to replace, currently.
19:36:22 <gregdek> Exclusions?
19:36:56 <rbergeron> also: we have Any namespace-specific module guidelines (identified as GUIDELINES.md in the appropriate file tree).
19:37:02 <rbergeron> as a line in this doc
19:37:11 <rbergeron> so - perhaps guidelines might be a better spot to put it
19:37:24 <rbergeron> or we rethink the whole thing again
19:37:35 <rbergeron> now that we know how things are going to split in the future
19:38:33 <rbergeron> gregdek: thoughts?
19:38:40 <rbergeron> i have no idea what bcoca meant about exclusions
19:38:57 <gregdek> Well.
19:39:01 <gregdek> I think:
19:39:07 <bcoca> many things process the repos, we need to exclude filenames from those
19:39:13 <gregdek> 1. In general, GUIDELINES.md is the right thing to call it.
19:39:13 <bcoca> mostly doc processing
19:40:11 <gregdek> 2. In general, GUIDELINES.md should have a sort of inheritance. Any directory with directory-specific guidelines should live in that directory's GUIDELINES.md.
19:40:42 <gregdek> 3. What you have as your current MODULEMAINTAINERS.md is a good start for the top-level GUIDELINES.md in Extras.
19:41:15 <bcoca> does it make sense to do now or wait to see if we merge all repos?
19:41:31 <mattclay> There's already a modules/extras/cloud/amazon/GUIDELINES.md
19:41:35 <gregdek> We should do it now.
19:41:39 <mattclay> So that fits.
19:41:43 <gregdek> Because it's already sorta half-done.
19:42:06 <gregdek> And it's going to evolve anyway.
19:42:21 <gregdek> rbergeron: does this make sense to you?
19:42:51 <rbergeron> gregdek: yes
19:43:16 <gregdek> ok, I'll put it in the issue.
19:44:25 <gregdek> Done!
19:44:26 <gregdek> Phew.
19:44:27 <gregdek> OK!
19:44:43 <gregdek> Moving on.
19:45:08 <rbergeron> gregdek: can we talk about ansible phx meetup?
19:45:15 <gregdek> We can!
19:45:29 <bcoca> only hold those in winter
19:45:43 <rbergeron> Good! I either need a password or to be added as an organizer because i now have a date and place.
19:45:45 <gregdek> #topic Ansible PHX meetup
19:45:53 <gregdek> Ah! I'll do that now!
19:47:00 <rbergeron> gregdek: thanks. and then i'll get it set up
19:49:25 <rbergeron> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kcgreen/this-is-fine-plush-dog <--omg
19:49:33 <gregdek> rbergeron: ok, your account should now have full status. Log in as you, and you should be able to manage that group.
19:50:01 <gregdek> And while we're at it... yeah, we're not having a meetup in RDU on August 11th.
19:50:11 <gregdek> Gonna try to reschedule in September.
19:50:35 <gregdek> Sigh
19:51:59 <rbergeron> yay
19:52:37 <gregdek> #topic Testing Working Group
19:52:42 <gregdek> gundalow: give us some good news :)
19:52:48 <gundalow> \o/
19:52:53 <gundalow> IT's AWN
19:52:59 <gundalow> (prounced one)
19:53:20 <gundalow> #info Testing Working Group will be starting soon, sign up at https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/114
19:53:35 <gundalow> (prounced 'it's on')
19:53:50 <gregdek> :)
19:53:53 <gregdek> Any luck picking a time yet?
19:53:59 <gregdek> NOT WEDNESDAY NEVER WEDNESDAY
19:54:03 <gundalow> Just need to work out a time that works for westcost and UK
19:54:18 <rbergeron> gregdek: when you go from "ansible kickoff" to "have an actual date" do you make a new meetup event or do you just edit the existing one that has "date tbd"?
19:54:19 <gregdek> That would be... no time, LOL
19:54:37 <gregdek> rbergeron: I edit the existing one because it has people subscribed to it.
19:54:38 <gundalow> I need to speak to my husband to work out what day of the week will work well for me working late
19:55:03 <rbergeron> gregdek: thought so.
19:55:05 <gregdek> Ah yes, domestic responsibilities come first, LOL
19:55:11 <gregdek> Well. Will wait on that then.
19:55:24 <gundalow> aka when he'd like me out the way :P
19:55:30 <gregdek> I presume you'll update MEETINGS.md directly when you know, keep us in the loop
19:55:36 <gundalow> yup :)
19:55:54 <gregdek> okeydoke!
19:55:59 <gundalow> stub and link to #114 is already in MEETINGS.md
19:56:05 <gregdek> Well then. Five minutes for open floor.
19:56:09 <gregdek> #topic Open Floor
19:57:04 <gundalow> Nothing else from me
19:57:22 <gregdek> Nor from me. Still recovering from various events, heh
19:57:44 <gundalow> I think I'm finaly over my jetlag
19:58:21 <rbergeron> i have nothing.
19:58:31 <gundalow> 90 seconds to spare!
19:58:53 <gundalow> Enjoy the rest of your day!
