16:05:10 <funzo> ok, did you want to discuss this PR with the group?
16:05:25 <caphrim007> nah, it's ready to go. it just needs a merge
16:05:29 <funzo> there are some sanity checks to fix up

16:10:57 <funzo> my pleasure

16:12:02 <caphrim007> umm
16:12:13 <funzo> just saw it as a link in the agenda
16:12:20 <Salman> Please do take some time out to discuss https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/26577 i
16:12:21 <caphrim007> is there?
16:12:38 <funzo> it was probably just referenced somewhere else
16:12:40 <funzo> we can move on
16:12:56 <caphrim007> ahh yeah it was just mentioned in that pr
16:13:00 <caphrim007> it's not ready yet in any event
16:13:01 <funzo> Salman: roger that, hang on to it and we'll come back to it
16:13:01 <caphrim007> 2.5
16:13:25 <funzo> FrederikSuijs: you have added an agenda item
16:13:45 <FrederikSuijs> Yes, no really sure if this was the right format
16:13:56 <funzo> #topic ios command prompt for confirmation
16:14:34 <funzo> FrederikSuijs: it's all good
16:14:54 <funzo> rcarrillocruz: did you catch FrederikSuijs' question on the agenda?
16:15:04 <Qalthos> there was some talk of ios confirmations before, I think, but I can't remember what became of it
16:15:12 <funzo> rcarrillocruz: do you recall?
16:15:20 <funzo> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
16:15:24 <funzo> last comment ^
16:15:25 <FrederikSuijs> Thanks, it looks like some people have encountered the same issues, but I couldn't find anything recent
16:15:33 <rcarrillocruz> FrederikSuijs: that link from groups google seems broken
16:15:36 <rcarrillocruz> mind pasting here?
16:16:01 <trishnag> rcarrillocruz: just updated the comment.
16:16:35 <FrederikSuijs> oops, I might have made a typo in the link
16:16:52 <rcarrillocruz> interesting
16:16:52 <FrederikSuijs> thanks trishnag
16:17:02 <rcarrillocruz> mind opening a GH issue with a playbook to reproduce
16:17:04 <rcarrillocruz> ?
16:17:08 <funzo> FrederikSuijs: so does peter's reply help you?
16:17:22 <rcarrillocruz> cos peter suggests there's a way to fix it, but i have to admit i've never used that response option
16:17:29 <FrederikSuijs> not really, is this documented ?
16:17:49 <rcarrillocruz> not sure
16:17:49 <FrederikSuijs> or some kind of hidden feature? I did try it, but couldn't get it working
16:17:51 <rcarrillocruz> let's do this
16:17:53 <rcarrillocruz> open an issue
16:17:58 <rcarrillocruz> with a playbook to reproduce
16:18:09 <rcarrillocruz> if the feature is there, and works, doc bug, i'll fix it
16:18:22 <rcarrillocruz> if it's a code bug, i'll fix and comment in the GH issue
16:18:37 <FrederikSuijs> ok, sounds like a plan!
16:18:43 <funzo> #action FrederikSuijs to open issue with playbook example to reproduce
16:19:00 <funzo> ok, next up...
16:19:21 <funzo> Salman: you wanted to go over an issue?
16:19:34 <Salman> Yes
16:19:39 <Salman> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/26577
16:19:44 <funzo> #topic 26577 https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/26577
16:19:54 <rcarrillocruz> i have issues to setup a config to repro the problem
16:20:06 <rcarrillocruz> it seems the issue just appears when advertised routes are more than zero
16:20:16 <Salman> Yes
16:20:26 <rcarrillocruz> Salman: can you provide an example to set up BGP in one or two routers
16:20:32 <rcarrillocruz> so the advertised-routes is more than 1
16:20:43 <rcarrillocruz> then once i have that set up i can repro the issue at ansible module level
16:20:52 <rcarrillocruz> i suspect it may be some terminal plugin regex problem
16:21:07 <rcarrillocruz> the fact rc is 0 or 1 depending on output leads me to think that
16:21:16 <Salman> In the same thread I have given output of what exactly the bjp output looks like
16:21:32 <Salman> bgp*
16:21:46 <rcarrillocruz> yeah, i see that, but i need a setup in the lab to get to that output
16:21:58 <Salman> I can get details as in how to set it up in lab
16:22:05 <rcarrillocruz> i.e. setup bgp, with networks correct so they shouw up as advertised routed
16:22:14 <Salman> Where shud I update that? In the agenda link?
16:22:22 <rcarrillocruz> k, thx, please paste that in the GH issue and then i'll move forward
16:22:27 <rcarrillocruz> Salman: the GH issue
16:22:37 <Salman> Got it.. Will do in few hrs
16:22:40 <Salman> Thanks
16:22:40 <rcarrillocruz> thx
16:22:45 <ganeshrn> rcarrillocruz: yup this seems a regex issue in terminal
16:23:19 <funzo> #action Salman to update GH issue with bgp setup
16:23:32 <funzo> Those are all the agenda items
16:23:35 <rcarrillocruz> ganeshrn: yah
16:23:40 <ganeshrn> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/plugins/terminal/ios.py#L44
16:23:57 <funzo> #topic open floor
16:26:12 <mikewiebe> This is not exactly network related but roughly how long do we have before 2.4 ships?
16:26:13 <Salman> I just have to thanks Pete for his session today. It was great
16:26:50 <funzo> mikewiebe: uncommitted timing of middle of sept given how everything comes together
16:27:28 <funzo> the more feedback we get on the RC releases and reported issues earlier than later will help us get it out more quickly
16:27:54 <funzo> mikewiebe: did I miss anything you put on the agenda for today?
16:28:06 <caphrim007> funzo: are new module commits frozen atm though?
16:28:17 <caphrim007> the previous date for that was the 15th
16:28:22 <funzo> yes
16:28:24 <caphrim007> k
16:28:28 <mikewiebe> funzo: Thanks for the info
16:28:33 <funzo> you betcha
16:28:55 <mikewiebe> funzo: No you did not miss anything from the agenda.  Just thought to ask now :)
16:29:06 <funzo> mikewiebe: ok, great
16:29:35 <funzo> I'll hang out here for a few minutes in case we have folks come up with an item for the open floor topic
16:30:37 <jmighion> funzo: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26769
16:30:49 <jmighion> it's functional, just battling shippable at the moment. needs a reviewer
16:32:15 <funzo> jmighion: got anyone one in mind for a reviewer?
16:32:16 <jmighion> side question : is there a better way to restart/rerun a shippable build than closing and reopening a PR?
16:32:30 <funzo> not unless you have a shippable login
16:32:51 <jmighion> funzo: not really. ganeshrn reviewed my last one, but it doesnt really matter to me who reviews it
16:33:06 <funzo> ganeshrn: you up for reviewing it?
16:33:09 <ganeshrn> i can review this
16:33:32 <funzo> #action ganeshrn to review https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26769
16:33:52 <jmighion> thanks
16:33:52 <funzo> just added you as reviewer on the PR
16:33:54 <rcarrillocruz> jmighion: there is , but you shippable account, we have a 'rebuild' button
16:34:15 <rcarrillocruz> you *need* i meant
16:34:28 <jmighion> oh yeah. i'd need merge permissions to ansible/ansible i think
16:34:34 <jmighion> got a shippable account
16:35:32 <rcarrillocruz> ah k
16:37:23 <funzo> ok, last call for open floor items
16:37:51 <funzo> Thank you everybody for your time today!
