15:07:01 <jtanner|t420> hi
15:08:17 <jhawkesworth> just making chat really, but I was wondering if much has come up since RC1 so far?  I haven't had much chance to test it myself yet.
15:08:19 <bcoca> gundalow: we left out some ideas that did not make it in 2.2 and 2.1
15:08:38 <gundalow> If you have anything for contributor summit feel free to add to https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-october-2016
15:08:40 <bcoca> ^ that is why im pushign for 'general list' so those are revisited and not having to have someone remember to bring them back up
15:08:46 <ryansb> jhawkesworth: I've got some (small) AWS bugs that have come up
15:08:53 <ryansb> but fixes are in progress
15:09:11 <bcoca> we got some big ones also
15:09:12 <jhawkesworth> cool.  I saw a performance thing but that looks fixed now
15:09:17 <bcoca> mostly include_role
15:09:21 <nitzmahone> couple of heisenbugs in the Windows async stuff it appears
15:09:38 <bcoca> short: there WILL be an RC2
15:10:49 <jhawkesworth> cool.  hoping for a bit of time next week to try it out
