19:04:11 <rbergeron> #topic Agenda
19:04:16 <rbergeron> https://waffle.io/ansible/community
19:04:31 <gregdek> OHAI
19:04:33 <rbergeron> there you go
19:04:33 <gregdek> ok.
19:04:42 <rbergeron> take the reins, fearless leader
19:04:53 <gregdek> #topic Contributor Conference SF Wrap-Up
19:05:07 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/93
19:05:13 <gregdek> So looks like we need:
19:05:19 <gregdek> 1. Video uploaded;
19:05:22 <gregdek> 2. Recap.
19:05:34 * gundalow returns
19:05:36 <gregdek> And you're working on 1, and we've got a meeting with RH PR to help with 2, right?
19:06:08 <rbergeron> yes.
19:06:13 <rbergeron> can you open this? https://youtu.be/Ly46x0nxjxk
19:06:24 <rbergeron> (so i don't have to get another laptop to test this again)
19:06:47 <rbergeron> Youtube is terrible when you have multiple accounts and want to look at other things.
19:06:48 <gundalow> rbergeron: "This video is private"
19:07:16 <gundalow> when I'm signed in with @redhat.com
19:07:16 <gregdek> "Sooooory about that!"
19:07:17 <rbergeron> try again?
19:07:29 * rbergeron just changed a thing
19:07:33 <gundalow> wirks
19:07:34 <gregdek> Got it!
19:07:35 <gundalow> works
19:07:38 <gregdek> w00t!!!
19:07:55 <rbergeron> okay. so - taht's the third one, the other two... are still processing. which could be an hour or a day
19:08:00 <rbergeron> depending on what hamsters are at the wheel
19:08:07 <rbergeron> and provided i don't log in to another account
19:08:12 <rbergeron> and foul things up
19:08:18 <rbergeron> which is what happened last time before i got very angry :)
19:08:19 <gregdek> Holy shit. That's a big beard.
19:08:36 <gundalow> rbergeron: Do you use Chrome, you can create separate profiles for personal & work
19:08:41 <gregdek> That is a Civil War General Shovel Beard.
19:08:45 <gundalow> gregdek: impressiv
19:08:46 <gundalow> e
19:09:03 <gregdek> Annnnyway! Looks like that's on track!
19:09:18 <rbergeron> gundalow: yeah, it's just... it is awful with youtube and uploads. We went through this at Elastic as well.
19:09:41 <rbergeron> "it works with chrome" does not always mean works with youtube while editing videos and uploading stuff.
19:09:43 <gregdek> So, very good.
19:09:51 <rbergeron> gundalow: i have tried, believe me :)
19:10:13 <rbergeron> so anyway, that's on track.
19:10:19 <rbergeron> and yes, we have a meeting with anna banana tomorrow.
19:10:38 <gregdek> OK! Hoping this is wrapped up by next week.
19:11:22 <gregdek> And we really should make this part of Anna's draft.
19:11:31 <gregdek> So let's move on:
19:12:15 * rbergeron looks at gregdek for moving on
19:12:20 <gregdek> #topic Planning for Contributor Conference Brooklyn
19:12:33 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/115
19:12:36 <gregdek> Sigh. OK!
19:12:46 <gregdek> So basically we go through the exact same playbook.
19:13:11 <rbergeron> Yeah.
19:13:43 <rbergeron> Do we have any specific folks over on that side of the country who might want to get in on this more?
19:13:46 <gregdek> So. What's our first step?
19:13:51 * rbergeron still kind of wonders if it's tooooo sooooon
19:13:51 <gregdek> We've got the Ansible NYC folks.
19:14:05 <gundalow> Do we have a list of contributors?
19:14:20 <rbergeron> Make an etherpad?
19:14:28 <gundalow> +1
19:14:35 <gundalow> then we can throw ideas for topics up
19:14:38 <gregdek> When in doubt, make an etherpad!
19:15:04 <gregdek> I can reach out to all the meetup group leaders on the East Coast.
19:15:07 <rbergeron> I mean -- we have the same list of folks that we've had, and i wonder if / when it's time to just have it be more wide open
19:15:14 <gregdek> Yes.
19:15:17 <gregdek> Have it wide open.
19:15:18 <rbergeron> that sentence was terrible
19:15:24 <gregdek> No, I get it.
19:15:27 <gregdek> Open it up.
19:15:32 <gregdek> We're ready.
19:15:44 <gundalow> No reason not to. Worse case we get a larger room
19:15:51 <gregdek> Yep.
19:16:00 <rbergeron> Or multiple rooms
19:16:08 <gregdek> We'll need to get core folks in early.
19:16:58 <gregdek> So. Want to take some time to set that up?
19:17:40 <rbergeron> yeah, after this meeting?
19:17:46 <rbergeron> or tomorrow morning?
19:17:53 <gregdek> tmrw morning works
19:17:59 <gregdek> lemme check calendar
19:18:25 <gregdek> ugh, no
19:18:59 <rbergeron> lol
19:19:02 <gregdek> ok, we can do 4:30 today
19:19:11 <rbergeron> ok
19:19:37 <rbergeron> you sure you want a half hour away from the computer? i mean... you love meetings nonstop
19:19:52 * rbergeron smiles sweetly
19:19:54 <gregdek> I have a meeting at 4.
19:20:08 <gregdek> :)
19:20:22 <rbergeron> oh, silly
19:20:27 <gregdek> Moving on!
19:20:30 <gregdek> #topic Module Maintainer Guidelines
19:20:35 <abadger1999> and ripost√©
19:20:40 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/81
19:20:47 <rbergeron> abadger1999: wot?
19:21:06 <abadger1999> rbergeron: complimenting greg on his reply ;-)
19:21:08 <gregdek> I believe it's a fencing term that translates roughly to "OH SNAP"
19:21:22 <rbergeron> ah
19:21:41 <gregdek> So! I see we have a new draft of module maintainer guidelines!
19:21:51 <rbergeron> okay, so: i have a pr for ... basically copying shit over from one to the other.
19:21:59 <gregdek> w00t
19:22:00 <rbergeron> and then we'll have to make updates to a few things.
19:22:02 <gregdek> url?
19:22:33 <rbergeron> I am conundruming a few things ...
19:22:33 <rbergeron> oh
19:22:35 <rbergeron> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2710
19:22:43 * gregdek looks
19:23:00 <rbergeron> it's the same. literally, because that's what we talked about, just ... refixing the name.
19:23:10 <gregdek> Yep.
19:23:21 <gregdek> The same as what's in your repo, right?
19:23:22 <rbergeron> but then we had a bunch of switcheroos in the bot since that time, and need to catch up on what is in movement there or not.
19:24:22 <rbergeron> no, i'm a moron
19:24:35 <gregdek> ?
19:25:04 <rbergeron> plz hold
19:25:09 <rbergeron> talk amongst yourselves
19:25:16 <gregdek> ok :)
19:25:26 * gregdek whistles
19:27:07 <gundalow> moooo
19:27:41 <rbergeron> okay
19:27:43 <rbergeron> i fixed it
19:27:51 <rbergeron> so yes! the same as what's in my repo except a minor fix
19:28:06 <rbergeron> well, a removal of a line that was a "should we x or y"
19:28:50 <gregdek> OK!
19:29:28 <rbergeron> but same things apply from above about need to fix minor link-ish things that i outlined in the issue
19:29:32 <gregdek> So this should pass travis, and when it does, I'll merge.
19:29:38 <rbergeron> thank you!
19:29:47 <gregdek> And you can submit extra PRs.
19:29:52 <gregdek> Can you remove a file as a PR?
19:30:25 <gregdek> I guess we'll figure it out!
19:30:28 <rbergeron> I have no idea.
19:30:37 <gregdek> OK, well, it's moving.
19:30:42 <gregdek> So that's good for now.
19:30:56 <gregdek> And I need a break :)
19:31:08 <gregdek> Anything else critical this go-round?
19:31:14 <rbergeron> no.
19:31:52 <gregdek> gundalow?
19:32:34 <gundalow> nah
19:33:04 <rbergeron> okay then!
19:33:08 <gundalow> I will speak with privateip tomorrow about are plans for Brooklyn. I believe we will be doing a Network Hub again.
