16:16:22 <funzo> ok, any other items to bring up to the group?
16:16:48 * skg-net waves
16:16:58 <funzo> o/
16:17:00 <privateip> hi skg-net
16:17:07 <skg-net> I would like discuss on Dell modules for Ansible 2.3
16:17:16 <skg-net> privateip: hi
16:17:26 <funzo> skg-net: ok, cool - what specifically would you like to talk about
16:18:38 <skg-net> I have submitted the PR for dellos9 and dellos10 https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/22856
16:19:13 <skg-net> would like to get it merged..
16:19:48 <funzo> privateip: have you looked over this, I see gundalow did
16:20:01 <privateip> i haven't but i have some time this afternoon to review it
16:20:55 * privateip commits to reviewing it in depth and comments (or merging) today
16:20:56 <skg-net> As part of the testing we found that, the facts for a CLI previously use to return..in a single item of the list..
16:21:14 <skg-net> Thanks @privateip
16:21:15 <privateip> thats a big PR
16:21:16 <privateip> :)
16:21:22 <privateip> np
16:22:15 <funzo> skg-net: thanks for your contribution!
16:22:45 <skg-net> Now, CLI show output is large, its splitting into multiple lines...
16:22:47 <funzo> skg-net: if you could watch it closely as it gets reviewed, we are really coming down to the wire on releasing 2.3 so any changes requested would need to be made quickly
16:23:00 <funzo> that will make it go much faster
16:23:01 <skg-net> is this expected
16:23:23 <privateip> no that is definitely not expected
16:23:49 <skg-net> Eg: For two elements in command list the responses list has three elements .i.e here the second command output is split and stored.   commands = [‘show version | display-xml’, ‘show system | display-xml’] responses = ['<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<rpc-reply>\n  <data>\n … </data>\n</rpc-reply>’, '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<rpc-reply>\n  <data>\n… <power-supply>', '<status>fail</status>\n
16:24:25 <privateip> yeah that seems odd
16:24:30 <skg-net> sure @funzo, will respond to comments as soon as possible..
16:24:34 <privateip> i suspect its a false positive on the prompt match
16:25:14 <skg-net> privateip: The code is mostly what you have written..:)
16:25:35 <skg-net> ok, will debug and keep you posted on that..
16:25:40 <privateip> oh in that case its correct... i never introduce bugs :)
16:26:12 <funzo> *crickets*
16:26:15 <privateip> lol
16:26:30 <privateip> that was hard to type with a straight ummm face ;)
16:26:39 <funzo> i got a great laugh out of it
16:27:01 <funzo> any other detail on that issue to discuss here?
16:27:14 <privateip> not until i can dig into it more this PM
16:27:14 <skg-net> How do we need to handle platform specific items in the new connection plugin ?
16:27:31 <privateip> what do you mean?
16:27:38 <privateip> do you have an example?
16:29:05 <skg-net> the terminal length 0 can be executed only when the device is authorized for dellos6
16:29:48 <skg-net> but in the current infra, its handled before the authorize..
16:31:25 <privateip> hmmmm
16:31:30 <skg-net> dowe write a new connection plugin in such case?
16:31:56 <skg-net> its just an example..dellos6 deviates more..
16:32:14 <privateip> there is an on_authorize hook in the terminal plugin
16:32:24 <privateip> that would allow you to run the commands post authorize
16:33:29 <skg-net> let me explore that option..
16:33:53 <privateip> kk
16:34:16 <funzo> alrighty, moving on then... any other issues to bring up to the group?
16:34:30 <skg-net> Last item..we also hit randomly the command output is partial sometimes..
16:35:23 <skg-net> this is with dellos9_command module..
16:35:37 <privateip> is there an open issue?
16:35:43 <funzo> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/22863
16:35:44 <funzo> like that?
16:35:48 <funzo> except not ios
16:36:22 <skg-net> yes thats correct
16:36:44 <skg-net> we haven't opened issues yet..
16:37:01 <privateip> please do for tracking purposes
16:37:10 <skg-net> sure, will do..
16:37:18 <privateip> thanks
16:37:43 <funzo> ok, if there are no other items to bring up to the group I'll pull the plug
16:37:50 <kennc> one sec
16:37:55 <funzo> kennc: o/
16:38:17 <kennc> with the new net_cli, what happens if the sessions fails between tasks?
16:38:36 <privateip> you mean if the connection drops?
16:39:12 <kennc> correct, or times out because the task before takes too long for all the hosts to complete
16:39:27 <privateip> the next task will create a new connection
16:39:30 <kennc> and can you confirm there is no going back to the old method if net_cli has issues?
16:39:39 <kennc> thanks for that info!
16:40:10 <privateip> did that answer both of your questions?
16:40:12 <funzo> also, if you know you are going to be running long tasks, there is a timeout you can alter just as an fyi
16:40:18 <privateip> yes
16:40:21 <kennc> no, just the first
16:40:51 <funzo> oh you want to know if there is a way to go back to the old method
16:41:11 <kennc> yes
16:41:23 <privateip> sorry im not following... whats the "old method"?
16:41:31 <kennc> not creating a socket
16:42:39 <kennc> and one more to add on, how to use delgate_to? Trying to wrap my head around ansible_ssh_user, I feel like that both the jump host and network device wants to use that
16:42:55 <privateip> no going back from the new arch
16:42:59 <privateip> no going back from the new architecture
16:43:29 <kennc> k, I like definitive answers, even when I don't agree :)
16:43:29 <funzo> you can just say 'ngbftna' and everyone will get it
16:43:54 <privateip> lol
16:44:08 <kennc> lol
16:44:12 <privateip> as far as delegate_to ... it doesn't work with the new connection plug
16:44:26 <kennc> now, i'll go back to my second question :)
16:44:44 <kennc> you see the issue here?
16:45:01 <privateip> but you can use ProxyCommand as documented
16:45:04 <privateip> http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/faq.html#how-do-i-configure-a-jump-host-to-access-servers-that-i-have-no-direct-access-to
16:45:12 <privateip> to achieve the same thing but in a more secure way
16:45:20 <kennc> ok.... that is the piece I was missing
16:45:26 <kennc> let me look at this
16:46:01 <kennc> can you add an action to add this to gundalow's documentation ?
16:47:07 <kennc> and potentially provide an example? not %100 making sense, but it sounds to be what I am looking for
16:47:07 <funzo> #action Add ProxyCommand reference for how to more securely replace delagate_to with net_cli
16:47:23 <kennc> thanks
16:47:53 <kennc> and I still still having issues with ios_banner, but rcarrillocruz is working on it
16:48:01 <kennc> that's it from me
16:48:37 <funzo> ok anyone else have anything for the group?
16:49:42 <funzo> thanks everyone for your participation
