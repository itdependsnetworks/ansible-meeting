15:01:03 <shertel> hi!
15:01:08 <gundalow> Agenda for today https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/123 if anyone has anything please add it there
15:01:25 <sivel> I am hereish, this meeting happens at the same time as my team stand up
15:01:28 <gundalow> #topic Pass the absolute path to dirname when assigning basedir https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/17457
15:01:30 <abadger1999> bon jour
15:01:31 <gundalow> _shaps_: over to you :)
15:01:46 <_shaps_> heh, that was quick :D
15:02:42 <gundalow> :D
15:02:49 <_shaps_> Is there an agreement on where that retry file should go in case of symlink?
15:03:45 <_shaps_> this will reflect which method to use
15:03:46 <gundalow> bcoca: abadger1999 You seem to be the active people on https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/17457 What's your thoughts about where that retry file should go in case of symlink?
15:04:15 <abadger1999> I think we all agree it should be placed next to the playbook's symlink?  Just have proposed different ways of putting it there?
15:04:28 <bcoca> on 'path given to ansible-playbook'
15:04:31 <abadger1999> bcoca: ^ Or do you think it should go next to the real file despite the symlink?
15:04:35 <abadger1999> <nod>
15:04:57 <_shaps_> right, so it won't follow the symlink
15:04:57 <bcoca> no, it seems i was commenting more on 'general function' than realizing exactly where they wanted the file
15:05:19 <bcoca> basedir shoudl not follow symlink since it is also way of 'using same play with diff resources'
15:05:29 <bcoca> i.e templates/group_vars/files/etc
15:06:06 <_shaps_> cool
15:06:30 <_shaps_> bcoca: not sure what your last comment means, but I assume is not really related
15:07:41 <_shaps_> I'll update the PR to use os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(playbook_path)) ( as mentioned in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/17457#discussion_r78130130 )
15:07:55 <bcoca> plays/play.yml
15:08:02 <bcoca> i can symlink to dev/play.yml
15:08:16 <bcoca> and use dev/templates/nginx.j2 vs prod/templates/nginx.j2
15:08:28 <bcoca> so everything for play should follow 'locallity' not origin
15:08:50 <bcoca> ^ allows for using filesystem as way of sharing/managing your resources
15:09:09 <bcoca> .retry shoudl follow same model
15:09:28 <bcoca> im just being  very verbose in agreeing
15:09:34 <_shaps_> thanks :D
15:10:58 * resmo waves
15:11:21 <_shaps_> cool, I'll update the PR later then
15:12:06 <gundalow> _shaps_: Thanks :)
15:12:40 <_shaps_> thanks bcoca / abadger1999 for clarifying that
15:12:54 <abadger1999> de nada

15:16:24 <resmo> after "freeze"
15:16:56 <gundalow> resmo: Test changes are fine
15:17:01 <gundalow> as a documentation improvements

15:20:56 <abadger1999> Cool.
15:21:03 <gundalow> woot, thanks
15:21:24 <gundalow> Last few hours of discounted tickets for Brooklyn https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest
15:21:53 <gundalow> also https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-contributor-summit-brooklyn-2016 we are building up the agenda now
15:24:45 <resmo> regarding bugfix PR in extras, is anyone looking at it as well?
15:25:00 <gundalow> resmo: How do you mean?
15:26:36 <_shaps_> I need to leave for another meeting, thanks again for before guys
15:26:42 <resmo> I mean, I see some PRs containing bug fixes and they look good (maintainer did not respond). I mark them for shipit but it would be great if someone could also give their +1 from core
15:26:52 <resmo> e.g https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/2643
15:27:02 <gundalow> _shaps_: Thanks
15:27:10 <bcoca> i normally go thorugh those on triage
15:27:22 <bcoca> but had small hiatus due to roles revamp
15:27:30 <bcoca> back on it though, will look through those tmrow
15:27:34 <gundalow> bcoca: Do you have a way of spotting PRs with a single "shipit"?
15:27:42 <bcoca> the label
15:27:48 <resmo> there are a few windows related bug fix PRs, I usually do not merged them as I get lost in powershell code :)
15:28:08 <bcoca> resmo: im alergic to powershell, normally ping nitzmahone for those
15:28:10 <gundalow> oh I thought it only had one "shipit" comment, not a label. OK :)
15:28:12 <bcoca> some i can read
15:28:16 <nitzmahone> I'll be doing a pass on those once I'm in "full bugfix mode" next week
15:28:24 <resmo> ack
15:28:27 <bcoca> gundalow: depends, shipit by 'maintainer' is supposed to trigger label
15:28:29 <resmo> makes sense
15:28:39 <bcoca> otherwise needs 2 shipit by 'other contributors' afaik
15:28:41 <gundalow> bcoca: TIL the above, cool
15:29:11 <bcoca> unless bot rules have changed?
15:29:22 <gundalow> I think you are right
15:30:02 <bcoca> you KNOW i am, specially when i'm not
15:30:52 <gundalow> :D
15:31:48 <resmo> ansible member can also give a shipit
15:32:46 <resmo> but if I give a shipit, it would makes sense if another member is merging
15:32:48 <bcoca> i nomrally just merge at that point, at least set label manually
15:41:06 <gundalow> I guess we are done
