17:01:36 <cinerama> o/
17:02:09 <gundalow> hi :)
17:03:48 <cinerama> don't see agenda for today but we talked a lot about zuul at the contributor summit
17:03:57 <gundalow> #topic Updates from Brooklyn Contibutors Fest
17:04:35 <cinerama> here's the etherpad from the zuul session on day one: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-october-2016-zuul
17:04:51 <gundalow> For those that weren't able to join on Monday there are some updates on the Testing working group on https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-testing-working-group
17:05:04 <gundalow> cinerama: Thanks, was just about to try and find that link :)
17:05:19 <cinerama> gundalow: and i was going to try to find the link you provided
17:05:58 <gundalow> :)
17:06:57 <gundalow> Other changes since then, we've started to move sivel's ansible-validate-modules into ansible/ansible. I'm working through refactoring how we do testing on the module repos
17:07:11 <cinerama> zuul things will not be ready for a while (maybe in march?) to use but folks are pitching in on getting it up and running - check in #zuul if you're interested in that effort
17:07:13 <gundalow> This will help us with the module merging
17:08:40 <cinerama> cool
17:09:06 <gundalow> Anyone else around today?
17:09:09 <sivel> lurking
17:09:17 <cinerama> unfortunately we didn't have etherpads for the second day that i'm aware of
17:09:18 <gundalow> Hello you :)
17:11:41 * mattclay waves
17:14:27 <gundalow> No ther updates from us as we've been busy with AnsibleFest
17:14:31 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
17:15:06 <cinerama> we also talked about validating roles from galaxy by running tests with zuul
17:15:48 <cinerama> possibly involving building images using diskimage-builder (from openstack land) and running roles on the built images i.e. to validate roles against a particular distro + version
17:15:59 <gundalow> cinerama: Can you let me know when the recording of Monday afternoon is available, I attended the docssprint
17:16:16 <gundalow> That's an interesting idea
17:16:17 <cinerama> gundalow: i will try to find out for you
17:16:22 <gundalow> Thanks
17:23:41 <cinerama> gundalow: will post up in #ansible-devel once i find out
17:24:18 <gundalow> Great
17:27:40 <cinerama> okay sounds like rbergeron is on it. we also have some whiteboard photos from day two that we can share
