19:07:10 <gundalow> jtanner: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/4012 Is that something you know about?
19:07:19 <gundalow> bcoca: win
19:07:28 <jtanner> i don't have ec2 creds
19:07:32 <bcoca> i had on my list to make same change
19:07:38 <jtanner> so, technically no
19:07:38 <gundalow> \o/
19:07:46 <bcoca> we moved to paging which meant old calc was wrong
19:07:55 <jtanner> 4012 looks to be merged

19:08:47 <resmo> :)
19:09:47 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
19:09:55 <gundalow> What else do people have/
19:10:04 <resmo> regarding new modules, I updated the changelog with a ton of new modules in extras
19:10:04 <jtanner> ansiblefest soon, buy tickets
19:10:18 <gundalow> resmo: thank you :)
19:10:30 <gundalow> https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest
19:10:32 <resmo> waiting for core as it seems the adding is not yet finished there
19:10:55 <jtanner> i had a script for that, not sure if it still works
19:11:16 <resmo> jtanner: I made a small bash script,
19:11:21 <gundalow> Early Bird pricing is availble till 16th September, so get them while they are hot https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest
19:11:26 <jtanner> forget what language mine is in
19:11:47 <jtanner> https://github.com/jctanner/ansible-tools/blob/master/modules_changelog.py
19:11:48 <jtanner> python
19:11:54 <resmo> what else :)
19:12:02 <jtanner> i'm not an addict
19:12:09 <jtanner> i tell that to my support group every day!
19:12:29 <gundalow> Do we have something to check/validate ansibulbot maintainers list?
19:12:39 <resmo> for sure
19:12:42 <jtanner> in what sense?
19:13:01 <gundalow> to say what modules aren't in MAINTAINERS-CORE/extras
19:13:27 <jtanner> right now, the bot just pings gregdek rbergeron and (resmo?)
19:13:54 <resmo> yeah, not the "best" solution...
19:13:59 <jtanner> but the issue triage side has a fallback to enumerating the author
19:14:23 <jtanner> i -think- that's in use, but not sure
19:14:33 <jtanner> something to review as i cleanup the new code
19:14:46 <resmo> jtanner: probably the bot should make an issue in ansibulbot repo :)
19:14:54 <gundalow> It's on my post 2.2 list to update ansible-validate-modules to ensure all author: fields are Name (@Account), and update any that don't pass
19:14:58 <jtanner> it can/should
19:15:20 <jtanner> could do neat things like that if i hadn't been spending so much time on the stupid rate limiting problem
19:15:38 <gundalow> hehe
19:15:58 <resmo> jtanner: so if missing maintainer, make a issue in ansibulbot, I can work on that
19:16:26 <jtanner> resmo, did you know there's a max 20 POSTs per hour minute, in addition to the 5000 GETs per hour?
19:23:44 <gundalow_> woot
19:23:47 <resmo> and back
19:23:48 <gundalow> ping
19:23:48 <gundalow> woot
19:24:33 <resmo> jtanner: nope, didn't know about rate limits, did we hit one?
19:29:23 <resmo> bbl
19:29:43 * gundalow assumes everyone is back in the room
19:33:02 <gundalow> and that there is nothing else
