Meeting summary
---------------
* LINK: Agenda https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/114
  (gundalow, 17:02:03)
* lxml  (gundalow, 17:05:01)
  * LINK:
    https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/114#issuecomment-311114266
    (gundalow, 17:05:11)
  * From Dag: For the new xml module, we need lxml provisioned. For the
    docker images, this is already the case, but for the VMs (FreeBSD,
    MacOSX) lxml is still missing.  (gundalow, 17:05:25)
  * ACTION: mattclay to look into lxml  (gundalow, 17:06:06)

* win_url integration tests (httptester for Windows)  (gundalow,
  17:06:30)
  * LINK:
    https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/114#issuecomment-311111626
    (gundalow, 17:06:47)
  * From Dag: For testing the win_uri module (and eventually the uri
    module as well) we would like to look at using httptester. This was
    deemed the preferred way during some discussion (don't have a
    reference at hand).  (gundalow, 17:07:04)
  * From Dag: For Windows that would mean that the VMs need to be able
    to connect the the httptester docker network. As a result, we will
    leave the idea to set up our own http listener process (#153
    (comment)).  (gundalow, 17:07:15)
  * We'd like to be able to tunnel requests from the remote Windows
    instance back to the system running the tests, but this is more
    difficult on Windows since we're not connection via ssh  (gundalow,
    17:09:30)
  * Idealy we want this to work when running ansible-test manually, not
    just on Shippable.  (gundalow, 17:09:52)
  * ACTION: mattclay to investigate this, he's got some ideas
    (gundalow, 17:10:47)

* Cleaning up test/  (gundalow, 17:11:01)
  * Clearing out test_win_group*.yml and some of the Makefile targets
    (gundalow, 17:11:26)
  * PR has been raised: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26255
    (gundalow, 17:11:42)
  * Waiting to check we will not break Ansible Tower testing  (gundalow,
    17:11:59)
  * Clearing out these files will make it a lot clearer for people
    creating tests  (gundalow, 17:12:44)

* Unit Test and mocking  (gundalow, 17:13:06)
  * We've been seeing an increasing number of unit test PRs wanting to
    add more test requirements.  (mattclay, 17:14:02)
  * Instead of adding more requirements for unit testing, we've been
    suggesting that unit tests mock their dependencies instead.
    (mattclay, 17:14:32)
  * Example https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/24895  (gundalow,
    17:14:39)
  * This reduces test requirements and focuses testing on modules, not
    their dependencies.  (mattclay, 17:15:28)
  * 2nd example https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/26026
    (gundalow, 17:15:41)
  * ACTION: caphrim007 to experiment with using mocking some of the F5
    unit tests and report back  (gundalow, 17:19:10)
  * ACTION: pdellaert to add pragmatic testing for Nuage  (gundalow,
    17:31:14)

* Reducing the dependencies in test/runner/requirements/integration.txt
  (gundalow, 17:34:09)
  * The list of "requirements" is ever growing. We plan on trimming that
    down to only what's needed to run ansible-test  (gundalow, 17:35:40)
  * For integration tests we are considering 1) requirements in
    test/integration/targets/*/requirements.txt  (gundalow, 17:36:55)
  * 2) or Just install them in during the playbooks. If they
    dependencies are needed by multiple roles then use a presetup_foo
    and set that in meta/main.yml dependencies  (gundalow, 17:37:44)
  * ACTION: agreed we will remove the integration dependencies and add
    them into the playbooks instead (in pretest_foo if needed by multple
    roles)  (gundalow, 17:43:13)
  * ACTION: , correction setup_foo  (gundalow, 17:45:13)
  * ACTION: also lets remove the empty setup_tests (from memory) that
    doesn't do anything  (gundalow, 17:45:41)

* Testing Working Group Structure  (gundalow, 17:45:53)
  * First of all, massive thank you to everyone that attended in person
    or online for the Contributors Summit as part of London Ansible Fest
    (gundalow, 17:46:27)
  * There was a lot of discussion about how to make it easier to Working
    Groups to document and self organise  (gundalow, 17:47:42)
  * https://github.com/ansible/community/ has been restructured there
    are now directories per working griup  (gundalow, 17:48:10)
  * group-windows is the best example  (gundalow, 17:48:23)
  * Also we have wiki's now https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki
    again Windows is best example  (gundalow, 17:48:44)
  * based on how k8s do stuff  (gundalow, 17:48:54)
  * we how have more IRC channels #ansible-aws #ansible-vmware
    #ansible-windows  (gundalow, 17:49:39)
  * LINK:

    (gundalow, 17:51:05)
  * LINK:
    https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/Windows%3A-community-plan
    (gundalow, 17:51:12)
  * ACTION: We will continue to use #ansible-devel as 1) Most of what we
    talk about relates to everyone 2) increase visibility  (gundalow,
    18:16:40)
  * AGREED: We will continue to use #ansible-devel as 1) Most of what we
    talk about relates to everyone 2) increase visibility  (gundalow,
    18:17:08)
  * ACTION: gundalow to add people to contact/collaborate on README.md
    (gundalow, 18:22:49)
  * ACTION: gundalow to look at old TWG etherpad and pull relevant info
    in  (gundalow, 18:23:14)
