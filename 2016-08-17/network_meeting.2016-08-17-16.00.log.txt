16:00:32 <Qalthos> hiya
16:00:33 * gundalow looks around
16:00:36 <caphrim007> yo
16:01:04 <gundalow> Hi Qalthos and caphrim007
16:01:34 <gundalow> Agenda, as always is https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
16:01:55 <mhite> ello
16:04:03 <gundalow> So looking through what's in the Agenda I don't see anything current for discussion
16:04:37 <caphrim007> i think my pr's are all caught up to date atm
16:05:36 <gundalow> 5~https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/554 "Modify F5 GTM Pool" still needs work
16:05:51 <gundalow> ah, that's with perzizzle
16:05:55 <caphrim007> perzizzle and i go back and forth on that
16:06:02 <caphrim007> there are times that we think its dead
16:06:13 <caphrim007> and then he pops back up and says he'll work on it
16:06:20 <gundalow> caphrim007: Anything we can do to help, or is it just with you guys?
16:06:47 <caphrim007> i'd be happy to finish it off for him in a different pr, considering i'll likely be maintaining it anyway
16:07:22 <gundalow> caphrim007: That sounds logical. Have you suggested that?
16:07:52 <caphrim007> not in this pr
16:08:08 <caphrim007> there was another he had that i offered @gregdek
16:08:34 <gundalow> Might be worth doing as you suggest
16:08:57 <caphrim007> okie doke
16:09:14 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:09:54 <gundalow> #action caphrim007 to contact perzizzle and finished off https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/554 "Modify F5 GTM Pool" which seems to have gotten stuck
16:09:57 <gundalow> Thank you :)
16:10:08 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:12:03 <gundalow> Internally we are continuing with the refactor that will be released in Ansible 2.2. Currently `devel` may be broken in places, so we suggest sticking with stable-2.1 branch
16:13:02 <gundalow> Qalthos: Anything you'd like to add?
16:13:05 <Qalthos> but if you're keen on being on the bleeding edge, please let us know what's broken
16:13:14 <gundalow> :)
16:13:20 <Qalthos> ^_^'
16:13:27 <caphrim007> its the only way to fly
16:14:00 <gundalow> Qalthos: Out of interest do you have any other F5 changes planned of the next month or so?
16:14:10 <gundalow> change everything to use docs_fragment?
16:14:32 <caphrim007> yeah i'll do that
16:14:39 <caphrim007> and i have more modules
16:15:00 <gundalow> \o/
16:15:32 <caphrim007> not sure what interest there is for this, but i also posted packerfiles and will post vagrant files i use to test our bigips
16:15:43 <caphrim007> may be relevant to someone that has VE's in house they want to use
16:15:56 <caphrim007> it's in the f5devcentral github org
16:16:14 <gundalow> It's on my list to setup CI for the networking modules, so that is interesting to me
16:16:44 <caphrim007> here are the packer templates for the moment
16:16:44 <caphrim007> https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-packer-templates
16:18:16 <caphrim007> ok, i pinged perzizzle. thats all i've got
16:19:11 <gundalow> mhite martian_law Qalthos: Anything else from you?
16:19:31 <mhite> nope
16:19:33 <Qalthos> none from me at the moment
16:19:50 <mhite> @caphrim007 looks good!
16:19:51 <martian_law> na, just joined to see what was happening.
16:20:18 <gundalow> martian_law: That's why we have the meetings in public. Do you use any of the Network modules?
16:20:44 <SKG_NET> I have raised a PR to include Dell networking in the 2.2 Roadmap
16:21:05 <SKG_NET> Can you merge that?
16:21:13 <gundalow> SKG_NET: Got a link/
16:21:23 <bcoca> roadmap is normally stuff we commit to doing, does not normally include community contributions
16:21:41 <martian_law> gundalow: we've only recently gone to 2.1 and haven't had much time to test them out. We're still using some custom modules that leverage napalm.
16:21:42 <SKG_NET> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/17114
16:22:39 <gundalow> SKG_NET: If those modules exist then that feels like something that should go into https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md
16:23:34 <SKG_NET> no not yet..we will start sending PR's for the actual modules by end of this month
16:23:46 <SKG_NET> I will update the changelog as well
16:23:57 <mhite> Is that for Force10 OS or Powerconnect OS?
16:24:10 <SKG_NET> for both
16:24:12 <gundalow> OK. I'll kill the ROADMAP one. Once the modules are in you can add them to CHANGELOG.md
16:24:19 <SKG_NET> and for the new OS10 as well
16:24:39 <mhite> @SKG_NET - Well that will be a nice addition.
16:24:50 <SKG_NET> I checked with Peter before raising this..
16:25:15 <SKG_NET> Couple of our customers also wanted to see that we are part of the Roadmap as well
16:25:21 <SKG_NET> Thanks @mhite
16:26:12 <caphrim007> gundalow, is that split between core and extras still happening?
16:27:12 <gundalow> caphrim007: ansible/ansible, ansible/ansible-modules-core and ansible/ansible-modules-extras will be merged into one Git repo, there will be an announcment soon
16:27:26 <gundalow> SKG_NET: ah, OK. I'll ping Peter and ask him
16:27:27 <caphrim007> k
16:29:52 <SKG_NET> ok
16:30:44 <gundalow> SKG_NET: Cool. I've added some comments on the PR. Please let us know once the modules are ready, feel free to add it to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
16:31:36 <gundalow> SKG_NET: End of the month will be tight for getting it into 2.2. Will require quick turn around of feedback. Should be possible though :)
16:31:48 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
16:32:36 <SKG_NET> We have a total of 16 modules... I can start sending them earlier once the testing is done...
16:33:12 <SKG_NET> sure
16:34:12 <gundalow> Sending through one module first may be a good idea. We often find when there are a collection of new modules we often give similar feedback (especially around documentation). So as soon as you are happy with one module send that through the process and we'll review it and you can apply that feedback to the other 15 modules
16:35:08 <gundalow> SKG_NET: If you can ensure the modules are clean according to:
16:35:21 <gundalow> pep8 -r  --ignore=E501,E221,W291,W391,E302,E251,E203,W293,E231,E303,E201,E225,E261,E241,E402 network/dell
16:35:45 <gundalow> That will make our lives a lot easier when we add in a CI test for Network Modules
16:36:17 <SKG_NET> sure will check them...
16:37:24 <SKG_NET> I will send the initial modules early next week...
16:38:19 <gundalow> SKG_NET: Excellent, feel free to add @gundalow on the review so I'll see them
16:38:31 <gundalow> So I guess we are done for today
16:38:36 <gundalow> Thanks for your time everybody
16:38:37 <SKG_NET> sure Thanks
16:39:05 <gundalow> As always if you think of anything feel free to add it to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/110
16:39:44 <gundalow> Reminder that the new "Testing Working Group" meeting starts tomorrow at https://duckduckgo.com/?q=1700+UTC
