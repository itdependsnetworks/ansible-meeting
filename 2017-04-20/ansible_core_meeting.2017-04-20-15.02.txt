  15:03:56)

    15:14:14)
  * ACTION: bcoca to write up his new idea roles as plugin installers
    (not installing and referencing role, but fetching and running role
    and have role itself install plugins and deps). means ansible-pkgmgr
    does almost nothing (fetch role which galaxy already does) + run it
    leave all logic up to role  (gundalow, 15:32:00)
  * rm setup.py?  (gundalow, 15:32:06)
  * for that ntc-ansible case, my suggestion would be to just add
    /path/to/ansible-ntc-repo/library/ to ansible module path
    (gundalow, 15:32:23)

* AnsibleFest Contributors Summit  (gundalow, 15:37:09)

  * If you think you can make it in person please ping me directly
    (gundalow, 15:38:04)
  * we will soon be asking for topics for the agenda, so have a think
    (gundalow, 15:38:27)

* Open Floor  (gundalow, 15:42:00)

* IRC Meetings  (gundalow, 15:42:45)
  * Does this schedule work for people, do we need to change it?
    (gundalow, 15:43:04)
  * Need to create a poll and ask the community, needs more thought
    (gundalow, 15:54:04)
