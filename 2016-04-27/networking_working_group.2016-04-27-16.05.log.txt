16:05:23 <privateip> hi all
16:05:35 <dgethings> hey
16:05:42 <privateip> welcome to the kick off of the networking working group community meeting for Ansible
16:05:49 <privateip> and thanks for joining us today
16:06:02 <privateip> Agenda for today
16:06:09 <privateip> * Team / Community Introductions
16:06:13 <privateip> * Meeting Goals
16:06:23 <privateip> * 2.1 Summary / Update
16:06:27 <privateip> * 2.2 Roadmap
16:06:34 <privateip> * Open Q&A
16:06:53 <privateip> any other agenda items anyone wants to add that doesn't fit in those topics?
16:07:44 <dgethings> none from me
16:08:00 <privateip> #topic Team and Community Introductions
16:08:25 <privateip> ok i thought since this is our first meeting i would take a moment to introduce key members of the Ansible community
16:08:45 <privateip> these are folks that you can call on anytime via IRC for help engaging in the Ansible community
16:08:55 <privateip> as I call on you, if you are here please say hi
16:09:33 <privateip> the overall Ansible community is run and managed by @gregdek and @rbergeron
16:10:20 <privateip> both are great resources for any help getting involved with any aspect of the Ansible community including outbound as well (meetups, conferences, etc)
16:10:28 * gregdek hullos and lurks
16:11:01 <privateip> next up is @newtMcKerr .... he manages the Ansible core engineering team
16:11:34 <privateip> you will find him lurking about here and there and always willing to swamp a good story or two
16:12:32 <privateip> we also have a number of folks from the core engineering team hanging around @bcoca @badger1999 @nitzmahone @jtanner (hope i dont miss any)
16:12:49 <privateip> all great resources to help you on our ansible journey working with the community
16:12:53 <bcoca> yes, but team is growing, i dont know full list either!
16:13:05 <nitzmahone> yo
16:13:31 <Qalthos> privateip: abadger1999
16:13:42 <privateip> finally myself @privateip (that was redundant) :) and @Qalthos
16:13:58 <Qalthos> Hello ðŸ‘‹
16:14:05 <privateip> the two of use are saddled with making networking magic happen in Ansible working with all of you
16:14:16 <dgethings> lucky!
16:14:24 <privateip> :)
16:15:05 <privateip> please feel free to reach out to any of us here ... you will find us hanging out at #ansible and #ansible-devel normally
16:15:11 * abadger1999 waves
16:15:25 <privateip> #topic Meeting Goals
16:16:07 <privateip> the reason we are putting this community together is to collectively build the best automation platform that supports networking period
16:16:41 <privateip> and we want to do this collaboratively as a community
16:17:07 <privateip> my single biggest goal is to enable all of you to become contributors in one way or another to Ansible
16:17:25 <privateip> even if you dont want to write code... there are plenty of other ways to get involved
16:17:44 <privateip> developing roles, best practices for networking, docs, the list is endless
16:17:56 <bcoca> writing docs ...
16:18:26 <privateip> to that end we have established this meeting to have a designated time and place to get together to review ....
16:18:31 <privateip> networking pull requests
16:18:36 <privateip> feature requests
16:18:42 <privateip> best practices
16:18:46 <privateip> general updates
16:19:12 <privateip> at the present time i have committed to being here every week at this time ... if that winds up being excessive we can scale the meeting back a bit
16:19:23 <privateip> biweekly or whatever makes sense
16:19:59 <privateip> i would ask folks that are currently maintainers of network modules to try to make as many of these meetings as possible as well
16:20:11 <privateip> this is where we will define "whats next?" for ansible and networking
16:20:23 <dgethings> ok, cool
16:20:36 <caphrim007> works for me
16:20:42 <privateip> if you want to contribute and not sure how to get started... please feel free to DM me (or anyone else on the team) and we can help you
16:21:16 <privateip> overall the goal is to be as open and transparent as possible moving forward so we all have inputs
16:21:30 <privateip> #topic 2.1 Summary and Updates
16:21:46 <privateip> Ansible 2.1 RC1 was released yesterday !!
16:22:08 <privateip> this is a big deal for networking as it s the first release that networking will be part of Ansible mainline
16:22:08 <dgethings> woot!
16:22:35 <dgarros> Congrats !!
16:22:35 <privateip> let me say firstly "Great Job!" to everyone that contributed and thank you for all your hard work
16:22:55 <privateip> but is definitely a marathon not a sprint :)
16:22:56 <caphrim007> privateip: mainline as in the networking modules are no longer in extras?
16:23:11 <privateip> we added over 50 modules for networking into 2.1
16:23:34 <privateip> most based on basic push of commands and collecting state (show commands)
16:23:52 <privateip> thats right @caphrim007
16:23:59 <caphrim007> roger
16:24:02 <privateip> networking modules are in ansible-modules-core
16:24:38 <privateip> over the next few weeks please test as much as your time allows and send in issue if you need but Pull Requests if you can :)
16:25:19 <privateip> supported platforms for 2.1 include eos, ios, iosxr, nxos, junos, openswitch, cumulus (in no certain order)
16:25:56 <caphrim007> privateip: for other networking-like platforms, should they continue to go in extras?
16:26:02 <privateip> in each of the cases we build _command, _config and _template modules (with some getting some additional ones)
16:26:06 <caphrim007> and have their maintainers maintain them there?
16:26:29 <mhite> also, will old modules for the aforementioned platforms be removed from -extras?
16:26:32 <privateip> @caphrim007 thats a good question
16:27:09 <privateip> i would say for starters lets have the conversations here about what work is being done and we can figure it out as we go
16:27:30 <privateip> @mhite i dont' think any of those platforms are in extras
16:27:58 <caphrim007> privateip: mhite and I are actively maintaining the bigip_* modules, for example
16:28:43 <privateip> i would like to see those moved into core
16:28:56 <privateip> are they all in extras today?
16:29:03 <ktbyers> Some of these new modules use SSH channel. Do you have plans on switching over to use API (assuming a reasonably good API exists), for example, Juniper?
16:29:06 <privateip> there is significant demand for them
16:29:08 <caphrim007> they are in a side-band repo at the moment
16:29:12 <mhite> privateip: my bad, i thought eos lived for a while in -extras
16:29:23 <caphrim007> since they are going through a lot of revs right now to make them stable
16:29:47 <dgarros> @ktbyers all junos_ modules are using netconf now
16:30:05 <privateip> @mhite yeah those were moved out some time ago
16:30:05 <ktbyers> Okay
16:30:27 <ktbyers> Using pyez/ncclient?
16:30:36 <dgarros> @ktbyers yes sir :)
16:30:37 <privateip> #action collect list of network modules in extras and present for next week discussion to move to core where applicable
16:30:47 <ktbyers> Okay, nice.
16:30:54 <jedelman8> @dgarros the junos_ modules in core or are you referring to the modules on the juniper repo?
16:31:02 <dgarros> both
16:31:09 <jedelman8> k, cool.
16:31:18 <jeffmcsco> @ktbyers Cisco Nexus at least has the option to use NXAPI or SSH
16:31:25 <mhite> is there a desire to have things that end up in core fit the _command, _config, and _template mold?
16:31:41 <privateip> @mhite doesn't have to fit that mold
16:31:56 <ktbyers> Sounds good...nice to have both (i.e. API + SSH)
16:32:00 <privateip> that was a catch all (least common denominator) across network devices
16:32:13 <privateip> so lets talk about 2.2
16:32:18 <privateip> #topic 2.2 Roadmap
16:32:37 <privateip> one of the things on the 2.2 roadmap is network abstractions and a want / need for them
16:32:55 <privateip> we have basic modules that wrap the CLI at the moment
16:33:16 <privateip> and there is a proposal in Ansible core to make roles more flexible for using them
16:34:02 <ktbyers> Can you expand on what that means..."make roles more flexible for using them"?
16:34:04 <privateip> ref: https://github.com/ansible/proposals/blob/master/roles_revamp.md
16:34:10 <privateip> sorry had lost the link
16:34:15 <ktbyers> Thanks.
16:34:40 <privateip> question i post here is thoughts around building abstractions for networking devices
16:34:56 <privateip> is there community demand for it
16:35:14 <privateip> if so, what should it look like
16:35:17 <dgarros> can you give an example of the type of abstraction you have in mind ?
16:35:26 <dgethings> tbh Iâ€™m just trying to get my head around what that would look like
16:35:55 <privateip> *_vlan: with args like vlanid, name, state, status, etc, etc (or whatever makes sense)
16:35:58 <jedelman8> are you talking about things like vlans,interfaces, etc. dare I saw common data model?
16:36:00 <jedelman8> yeah
16:36:01 <privateip> yep
16:36:21 <privateip> i wouldn't think data model as much as abstraction of the resource
16:36:27 <jedelman8> right
16:36:31 <privateip> the data model is still over the top that implements the resource
16:36:48 <ktbyers> I think we should probably think more about higher level functions that people want to do--like config change, OS upgrade, fact gathering (show commands)
16:36:57 <ktbyers> i.e. what operations are people looking to automate.
16:37:42 <jeffmcsco> we have this option with nexus thanks to jedelman8, but i still see ansible used a lot for CLI templating
16:37:57 <jedelman8> I think it'd be difficult for device features, but we have some modules that support 4 vendors on system level tasks such as rebooting systems, backing up configs, etc.  have no issue getting these into core/extras.  but today they support junos, ios, nxos, and eos.  they are actually modeled after features juniper already has.
16:38:16 <jedelman8> these also support facts, upgrades, etc. @ktbyers
16:38:37 <jedelman8> for your viewing pleasure later: https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-ansible/tree/master/library
16:39:25 <jedelman8> based on demand, they could be kept as-is or fully de-coupled to nxos_ eos_ ios_ ...
16:39:31 <ktbyers> Personally, I don't think it matters if it is in core/extras or not, but open to argument that it does matter.
16:39:59 <privateip> this brings up an additional question around platform neutral vs platform specific modules
16:40:05 <jeffmcsco> you get into vendor-specific stuff quickly (VPC vs MCLAG, etc) but it would be nice to have some standard abstractions that are cross-vendor with vendor-specific as needed
16:40:19 <privateip> remember we can do that with roles
16:40:40 <kei> +1 for roles! :)
16:40:42 <privateip> we dont (and I believe shouldn't) build functionality that is already available
16:40:48 <bcoca> think of the 'package' module, it does some generic, but its really the specific apt/yum/etc that do the heavy lifting as their 'api' is very differnt
16:40:52 <kei> though am open to anything. :)
16:41:02 <bcoca> ^ the generics are nice, but they are limited to being 'generic'
16:41:16 <jedelman8> Yeah, from a maintability and time to market, roles are probably the way to go for features, at least for now.  but system level things are still an option for multi-vendor modules
16:41:18 <dgethings> my view is that the abstraction has to make sense in the context of what the user is trying to achieve. Adding a vlan is all good an well but is only useful when part of orchestration that also spins up the associated VM, for example
16:41:27 <kei> bcoca: true.
16:41:45 <bcoca> the abstraction is limited by the reality of the diversity of existing systems
16:42:20 <ogenstad> One thing I think we need is some handling of public ssh keys of the devices we connect to. Most current networking modules just ignore the keys. This can work fine in internal environments but isn't great if you need to connect to devices over an untrusted medium.
16:42:38 <bcoca> if all packages/packaging systems would be the same, 'package' would be great, the way the networking world is, i think this is something to strive for
16:43:07 <privateip> @ogenstad agreed... do we have a feature request filed for that?
16:43:27 <ogenstad> Not by me...
16:43:42 <bcoca> privateip: we can reuse the per host/group ssh args that we already use in inventory
16:43:43 <privateip> are you good to file one?
16:44:09 <privateip> yep good idea
16:44:26 <ogenstad> Sure, I can write something
16:44:45 <privateip> #action file feature request for handling ssh keys
16:45:06 <mhite> i'd suggest that we ask vendors to support some basic set of modules, ie. config, facts -- table stakes basically. we then create another set of very common primitives, ie. vlan, bgp, ospf, lldp, etc. that can be optional. then another set of suggested modules can be vendor specific stuff, ie. entities that vary from vendor to vendor.
16:45:11 <privateip> ok in the interest of time im going to start a proposal on a abstractions
16:45:22 <privateip> it will be posted here: https://github.com/ansible/proposals
16:45:39 <mhite> [and by say 'we ask vendors', i really mean the community. sorry. ]
16:45:41 <privateip> i would ask those that feel strongly one way or another please ocntribute
16:45:47 <privateip> contribute even
16:46:34 <privateip> next item is support for additional networking OS
16:46:56 <privateip> i sent a list around as food for thought: quagga, ovs, gobgp, others?
16:47:18 <privateip> looking for feedback and volunteers to help develop these (assuming they make sense)?
16:47:26 <mhite> firewalls?
16:47:34 <dgethings> sorry all. gotta drop. Iâ€™ll hang on here so I can read up on what was dicussed
16:47:36 <dgethings> cheers all
16:47:45 <jedelman8> was just thinking that mhite
16:47:51 <ogenstad> I have some plans on creating modules for Cisco ASA.
16:47:52 <privateip> definitely open to other firewalls as well
16:47:54 <jedelman8> Palo Alto Networks has a bunch I'll be testing soon
16:48:19 <ktbyers> Yes, ASAs are a big gap...so nice ogentstad.
16:48:32 <jedelman8> not sure if PAN is planning to get theirs into core...or if they are present today.
16:48:33 <privateip> thats great
16:48:38 <mhite> wireless products also
16:49:03 <jedelman8> love seeing non DC products mentioned :)
16:49:07 <privateip> #action start proposal with list of identified platforms to support
16:49:19 <privateip> i will get the list started and share via ansible ML
16:49:23 <dgarros> Would be great to have support for IXIA & Spirent as well
16:49:50 <privateip> please remember though ... these are all great ideas and nice to haves but we need community involvement to make it reality
16:49:52 <privateip> :)
16:49:59 <jedelman8> :)
16:50:02 <privateip> let me be more direct
16:50:02 <yonradz1> mentioned ^^ I think but the most common enterprise ADCs (F5 BIGIP, A10 ACOS, etc)- will any be incorporated / built-in to the main release in the future? Happy to help on the F5 BIGIP front with use cases, etc.
16:50:05 <privateip> community development
16:50:09 <bcoca> nah, you can do this all yourself, tomrrrow deliver?
16:50:16 <privateip> hahahaha
16:50:24 <ogenstad> I just need you to fix that ordering bug before I start ;)
16:50:32 <kei> do we have someone from quagga, ovs, or gobgp here?
16:50:33 <caphrim007> @yonradz1 yes. mhite and I are doing the bulk of the work on the F5 modules
16:51:13 <caphrim007> @yonradz1 I'd love to hear more use cases
16:51:17 <privateip> ok i will get the list started ... please subscribe to ansible ML if you aren't already and we can continue discussions there
16:51:29 <privateip> # topic Open Q&A
16:51:46 <privateip> floor is open ... anything you want to discuss
16:51:55 <alikins> how will network modules be integrated into testing/qa/ci?
16:51:55 <mhite> testing testing testing
16:51:57 <yonradz1> excellent! i'm doing a bulk migration of about 150 Virtual Servers from one LTM pair to another today and then working on some GTM stuff. will followup with you or feel free to reach out.
16:52:01 <privateip> #topic Open Q&A
16:52:02 <dgarros> any plan for network testing ?
16:52:10 <mhite> @alikins - jinx ;)
16:52:29 <caphrim007> yeah +1 testing
16:52:32 <kei> dgarros: great topic, network testing in ansible!
16:52:34 <ktbyers> Is there movement to have a transport span multiple tasks (for example, an API connection or SSH connection). Especially, in connection: local context.
16:52:39 <profetik> documentation documentation documentation -- something that someone who maybe hasn't written a module can understand
16:52:41 <privateip> im looking at how best to do this now ... is a very complex problem
16:53:09 <kei> privateip: which one, testing or transport?
16:53:09 <privateip> for starters we have published testing playbooks for networking that anyone can use and contribute to
16:53:15 <privateip> oops... testing
16:53:25 <kei> privateip: awesome, links?
16:53:26 <privateip> we are working to get them updated
16:53:45 <kei> privateip: i'm more than happy to contribute.
16:53:50 <dgarros> https://github.com/ansible/test-network-modules
16:53:58 <privateip> my first inclination is to start a community of testing playbooks all following a similar desing at that anyone can use
16:54:15 <privateip> that way anyone can pull them down and run them in their own env / labs
16:54:18 <profetik> ^
16:54:30 <caphrim007> @dgarros thanks for that
16:54:35 <privateip> further down the road I would like to have a more integrated testing approach
16:54:56 <privateip> but that has complications as network OS in VM  != network os on the device in all cases
16:55:27 <privateip> @profetik anything in particular you are looking for
16:55:43 <privateip> ie module development? playbooks development?
16:56:17 <privateip> #action update on testing framework for next week
16:56:37 <profetik> Generally when looking at ansible documentation - it seems to be written for folks who are already well-seasoned at Ansible. To gain some momentum we'd want to make documentation that makes sense for an average user.
16:57:17 <profetik> This is mostly around plabook development.
16:57:17 <gregdek> profetik: maybe a special getting started guide for networking users?
16:57:23 <profetik> ^
16:57:24 <mhite> Reference vs. guides
16:57:43 * kei gotta go in a couple of min...
16:58:06 <privateip> ok lets keep that convo going either via ML or next week as we are at the top of the hour
16:58:13 <nitinkr> after 2.1 release, if any major bugs are fixed in the modules, what will be the time frame of next minor/major release? can these locally changes modules be used via roles (by easy way)
16:58:20 <privateip> thanks everyone for joining ... great start
16:58:25 <profetik> i think privateip's idea of a library of sample playbooks is a good start, but writing your own instead of hack-fu'ng existing playbooks could use better docs.
16:58:35 <privateip> hope to see you all in the IRC rooms and on the ML
16:58:40 <profetik> Thanks for the invite!
16:58:55 <kei> thanks team!
16:58:58 <privateip> @nitinkr can you post that to the ML?
16:59:10 <privateip> #endmeeting
