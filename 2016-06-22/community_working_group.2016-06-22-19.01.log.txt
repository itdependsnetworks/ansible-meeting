19:01:56 <rbergeron> good lord, i had forgotten that that movie EVEN EVER EXISTED, nitzmahone :)
19:02:19 <gregdek> ugh
19:02:24 <nitzmahone> I ashamedly use "two minutes" in a faux Indian accent way too often
19:02:26 * rbergeron is here and present... duuuuuuude
19:02:31 <nitzmahone> My wife gets it. :)
19:02:32 <gregdek> buuuuudy
19:02:39 <nitzmahone> weezin the juice!
19:02:51 <gundalow> Only half here for this meeting
19:03:03 <rbergeron> well, i think we're only here for half the meeting
19:03:06 <rbergeron> so that works out :)
19:03:10 <rbergeron> sort of
19:03:11 <rbergeron> :)
19:03:15 <gregdek> #topic Agenda: https://waffle.io/ansible/community
19:03:19 <gregdek> Yep, short one today
19:03:33 <gregdek> #topic Contributor Conference
19:03:41 <rbergeron> :)
19:03:52 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/93
19:04:09 <gregdek> Badly behind here.
19:04:32 <gregdek> Must catch up quickly; we're only a month out.
19:04:36 <rbergeron> i think we're kind of behind on a bunch of stuff :( but this one.. yeah, that.
19:04:41 <gregdek> We've got a basic agenda, but we need to get invites out.
19:05:11 <gregdek> rbergeron: got time to work on that with me tomorrow?
19:05:13 <rbergeron> gregdek: want to ..
19:05:14 <rbergeron> yes
19:05:17 <rbergeron> jinx. :)
19:05:39 <gregdek> Put a meeting in for whenever you're free. I'll be around the whole day.
19:05:52 <rbergeron> okay!
19:06:50 <gregdek> Next:
19:07:17 <gregdek> #topic Module maintainer guidelines
19:07:28 <gregdek> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/81
19:07:37 * jimi|ansible is sick of being behind...
19:07:38 <rbergeron> gregdek: meeting time is set up.
19:07:44 <gregdek> rbergeron: do you remember where we left this?
19:07:55 <gregdek> jimi|ansible: I feel you :/
19:07:59 <rbergeron> hey, i haven't looked at this in the past week! I barely remember. I wrote some things, and... fuzzy after that.
19:08:07 <rbergeron> and then "omg a conference" and other stuff
19:08:15 * rbergeron looks
19:08:20 <alikins> hmm, I think I started some notes on this
19:08:22 * alikins looks
19:08:45 <jimi|ansible> i think not moving cross-country every year should help though...
19:09:12 <rbergeron> gregdek: i think this was now down to things like "cross-checking other sources of info to make sure we're not conflicting with ourselves anywhere"
19:09:31 <rbergeron> along with "posting it"
19:09:59 <rbergeron> so... yeah. it's less of a fire than the conference, but needs doing
19:10:13 <rbergeron> though i feel like maybe it will be a good hidey-hole escape thing to do next week during other things :)
19:10:38 <gregdek> LOL. I wish.
19:10:43 <gregdek> We both know that's not happening.
19:11:10 <gregdek> Realistically, we're looking at week after Summit before we do anything more.
19:11:21 <gregdek> But it's not on fire!
19:11:23 <gregdek> So it can wait!
19:11:33 <rbergeron> yes. the other thing is a fire, so ... tomorrow :)
19:11:57 <alikins> https://github.com/alikins/ansible-modules-extras/commit/c87795da5b0c95c67fea1608a5a2a4ec54cb3905  is just a start of a braindump, likely not useful
19:13:45 <rbergeron> actually, a bunch of that is useful / good --
19:13:54 * rbergeron puts a link to that in the community issue
19:14:02 <gregdek> Oo!
19:14:07 <gregdek> Yes. Good stuff.
19:14:19 <gregdek> Thanks alikins!
19:14:26 <alikins> the 'gold star' case is kind of an imaginary wonderland, but alas
19:14:46 <rbergeron> i got a gold star while i was at ice skating yesterday
19:14:49 <rbergeron> :D
19:14:51 <gregdek> We'll get there one day!
19:15:01 <gregdek> And what was your gold star for? Anything in particular?
19:15:36 <rbergeron> showing up and being awesome
19:15:45 <rbergeron> and figuring out my center of gravity issues
19:15:50 <gregdek> Hey... that's what we're doing today, too!
19:15:54 <rbergeron> exactly
19:15:54 <gregdek> Minus the center of gravity issues.
19:15:57 <rbergeron> well.
19:16:02 <rbergeron> are you saying i'm not the center of gravity?
19:16:05 * rbergeron pouts
19:16:07 <gregdek> Yes.
19:16:09 <gregdek> ANYWAY.
19:16:12 <rbergeron> :D
19:16:13 <gregdek> #topic Open Floor
19:16:36 <gregdek> Anything we should be thinking about with Summit next week?
19:16:46 <rbergeron> are we demo'ing ansible-container at our booth?
19:17:02 <rbergeron> should i bring my extra macbook pro so we have something to demo on that isn't our personal laptop(s)?
19:17:59 <rbergeron> should we cancel this meeting for next week since.... booths and talks and bears, oh my?
19:18:50 <alikins> my not very secret agenda would be get vendors/customers/etc thinking about providing test/ci/qa infrastructure for modules tied to their products, ala previously mentioned gold star
19:19:56 <alikins> 'It would be a shame if your module happened to fall into not-even-extras, knowwhatimean? Maybe you could help us out a little?'
19:19:58 <gregdek> * Yes, we are probably demoing ansible-container at the booth.
19:20:23 <rbergeron> alikins: i like to think of that as the silver robot rather than the gold star :)
19:20:32 <gregdek> * Yes, bringing an extra MacBook would probably be useful.
19:20:38 <rbergeron> mostly because gold star is like... soooo vague sometimes :)
19:20:41 <gregdek> * Yes, we should cancel this meeting for next week.
19:23:22 <gregdek> Anything else urgent? :)
19:23:24 <rbergeron> okay! I will bring my macbook.
19:23:34 <rbergeron> My hunger.
19:23:40 <rbergeron> is kind of urgent but it will wait. :)
19:25:18 <gregdek> :)
19:25:20 <gregdek> ok.
