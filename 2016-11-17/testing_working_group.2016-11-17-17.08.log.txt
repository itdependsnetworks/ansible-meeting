17:08:56 <gundalow> bcoca: For extending test cases can you please raise an issue and let me know
17:10:03 <gundalow> We are experimenting with GitHub projects to track infrastructure and test improvements https://github.com/ansible/ansible/projects/3
17:11:30 <bcoca> gtk
17:14:30 <gundalow> On the topic of getting more tests I know a number of you have test cases in your own repos, post repo merge & static analysis work we'd like to get those added into ansible/test/...
17:21:24 <gundalow> Who has tests in their own repo
17:21:31 <gundalow> I think I've seen some in alikins's GH
17:23:08 <alikins> I try to keep bits I use to reproduce bugs in https://github.com/alikins/ansible-bug-repro   (They are likely candidates for making into integration tests)
17:24:10 <gundalow> cool
17:24:12 <gundalow> Thanks
17:24:19 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else?
17:28:56 <alikins> any reason https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/18107 isnt merged?
17:30:07 * gundalow looks
17:30:34 <gundalow> Good spot,merged
17:31:54 <gundalow> ending in a few minutes for dinner and also 2.5 hours of meetings is enough :)
17:31:58 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
17:33:05 <alikins> for unit tests, I have https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/18086
17:33:59 <alikins> (It currently fails on xen guests, which I can fix with some mock gymnastics or some minor changes to facts.py)
17:34:49 <alikins> but curious if that kind of test setup or unit testing facts is acceptable and looking for feedback
17:34:49 <gundalow> Cool
17:35:01 <gundalow> Matt and I will have a look at it
17:35:18 <gundalow> Did we have some bugs in that area, is that why you created it?
17:35:28 <alikins> yup
17:35:39 <gundalow> cool
17:35:54 <alikins> and I've written cpu info facts... 5 times now?  And I know how fragile it is.
17:36:40 <gundalow> I see, defo makes sense to add some tests around that
17:37:04 <gundalow> I'll speak with Matt and let you know
17:37:06 <gundalow> Thanks :)
17:37:08 <gundalow> right dinner
