17:00:34 <gregdek> #topic roll call
17:01:01 <gregdek> Note that a lot of core devs are at PyCon this week, so we may not get a lot of participation from them this time around.
17:01:06 * gundalow waves
17:04:21 <gregdek> Just us :)
17:04:31 <gregdek> #topic Open Floor
17:04:45 <gregdek> So I'm just gonna open the floor in case there's anyone with a particular module to advocate for.
17:04:47 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/15928 PEP8ish doc update
17:06:01 <gregdek> Waiting on core team to merge, I guess. It is what we agreed to.
17:06:15 <gundalow> OK
17:06:34 <gregdek> dag's points there are well taken.
17:06:51 <gregdek> But it is what we agreed, so we'll go with it.
17:07:36 <gundalow> aye. I was chatting with a few Python people in the pub recently. Their thoughts were it's better to have a clear set of rules which will mean less back and forth, as shown in dag's PR
17:08:46 <gregdek> Yeah.
17:08:56 <gundalow> nothing else from me
17:09:25 <bcoca> most contriubtors are not traditional python devs, SAs/automators are much less formal about these things
17:09:32 <gregdek> thanks gundalow -- we'll give it a few more minutes and if no one shows we'll adjourn and pick up again.
17:10:01 <gundalow> Sure, I was expecting a few more people based on the comments from an hour ago
17:10:46 <gundalow> ttom: MichaelBaydoun Anything for New Modules meeting?
17:11:17 <MichaelBaydoun> gundalow: nothing from me, my next contribution still needs some work
17:11:32 <gundalow> MichaelBaydoun: cool. Looking forward to it :)
17:13:40 <gregdek> GAH
17:13:56 <gregdek> Well, maybe it's because the meeting isn't for another 45 minutes. &#%@
17:14:05 <gundalow> gregdek: lol
