16:08:03 <gundalow> caphrim007: minus points for not getting lcd_display working on virtual machines :P
16:08:09 <caphrim007> lol
16:08:14 <caphrim007> i know. my bad
16:08:22 <gundalow> Though plus points for actually documenting it
16:08:45 <gundalow> "
16:08:57 <caphrim007> i need to replace the filing cabinets holding my desk up with bigip viprions
16:08:57 <gundalow> "description: >"
16:09:04 <caphrim007> then i can test lcd
16:09:16 <gundalow> and maybe some earplugs?
16:09:22 <gundalow> How come you have ">"
16:09:44 <caphrim007> on which pr
16:09:56 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/3271/files#diff-891108651bca780943a13ae56dfd9180R115
16:10:25 <caphrim007> ahh. i think that was before i discovered that strings can be moved to a new line and dont need the folded scalar yaml
16:10:48 <caphrim007> is it causing the docs to bug out?
16:11:25 <gundalow> nah, just querying it
16:11:46 <gundalow> apparently it's valid YAML, so should be fine
16:13:00 <gundalow> all merged
16:13:16 <caphrim007> thats all from me this week
16:13:30 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/5381 ?
16:13:38 <gundalow> Just looked at your PRs,
16:13:49 <caphrim007> nitzmahone took care of that yesterday
16:14:15 <gundalow> cool
16:14:19 <caphrim007> we were figuring out this win_shell problem and that PR i had was an example
16:14:40 <gundalow> cool
16:16:40 <gundalow> caphrim007: You may wish to create a stable-2.2 branch for https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-ansible if you are now adding in tests for 2.3
16:16:54 <caphrim007> for bugfixes?
16:17:16 <gundalow> So you can run the set of tests for 2.2 against Ansible 2.2
16:17:37 <gundalow> We've done the same for stable-2.1 https://github.com/ansible/test-network-modules/branches
16:17:48 <caphrim007> ok
16:18:45 <gundalow> Not created the stable-2.1 for test-network-modules yet as we've not added any 2.3 functionality or tests yet
16:19:46 <caphrim007> so for 2.2
16:20:00 <gundalow> Not created the stable-2.2* for test-network-modules yet as we've not added any 2.3 functionality or tests yet
16:20:06 <gundalow> sorry, typo
16:20:31 <caphrim007> is devel going to be 2.3 though?
16:20:43 <caphrim007> and the stable-2.2 will be 2.2 and 2.2.1, 2.2.2, etc?
16:21:54 <gundalow> stable-2.2 = 2.2*
16:22:09 <caphrim007> k
16:22:44 <gundalow> minor thing, but worth mentioning since you are already adding in functionality for 2.3
16:23:27 <caphrim007> since i have limited ansible cycles, i will tend to only produce bugfixes for 2.2.*
16:23:39 <gundalow> ACK
16:23:40 <caphrim007> and everything else will just "move forward" so-to-speak with 2.3
16:24:17 <gundalow> Just means if we make some change to Ansible 2.2 that may impact networking we have the ability to run tests against it
16:24:30 <caphrim007> roger that.
16:24:38 <gundalow> cool
16:24:48 <gundalow> Anything else?
16:25:03 <caphrim007> i'm good this week. more next week
16:25:07 <gundalow> cool
16:25:09 <gundalow> Thank :)
