16:14:56 <gundalow_> #topic Ansible Network Sprint session for PyCon 2017
16:15:03 <misc> hi
16:15:13 <misc> which pycon ? pycon us ?
16:15:14 <gundalow_> ericchou1: good idea, I guess the main question is what will be done
16:15:24 <ericchou1> right
16:15:45 <ericchou1> I will work on A10 modules since they are paying for the trip
16:16:11 <ericchou1> but want to get together and just learn more about Ansible in general
16:16:28 <ericchou1> last year Ansible had a booth but no network people there, I think
16:16:52 <ericchou1> it is still a few months away so just want to bring it up here so we can all plan ahead
16:16:59 <Qalthos> misc: US
16:17:17 <gundalow_> #chair Qalthos

16:22:20 <gundalow_> Thanks for the suggestion, I pushed it up to others to get their input
16:22:34 <ericchou1> Thanks!
16:24:42 <caphrim007> gundalow: semi networking related. Did you or privateip have any thoughts on that transport question i had?
