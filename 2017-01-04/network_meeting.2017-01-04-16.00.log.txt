16:03:41 <gundalow> allanice001: How you getting on, anything you'd like to discuss?
16:03:49 <gundalow> You were looking at NSoT?
16:03:50 <allanice001> all good
16:04:03 <allanice001> got one minor issue that may be of interest
16:04:39 <allanice001> re - child modules (like pysnot pyjuniper etc etc)
16:04:49 <gundalow> #topic child modules (like pysnot pyjuniper etc etc)
16:05:00 <allanice001> gee thanks :D
16:05:36 <allanice001> one thing i noticed is these modules grow idependantly of either their parent projects and ansible
16:06:19 <allanice001> so, compatibilty testing becomes a bit of a headache when versionioning dependancies / contrib modules
16:07:00 <allanice001> any ideas on how to tame it down ? (meta data with dependancy tracking is what i thought of)
16:07:46 <gundalow> Would really need Peter's (privateip's) ideas on that one
16:07:57 <bcoca> that is one of the 'future' plans for metadata
16:09:07 <gundalow> Would one use case be adding in meta data to say "This module requires/has been tested with pyLibFoo versions 1.2-2.1
16:09:10 <gundalow> "
16:09:12 <allanice001> in the example of my PR (which i’m still working on) https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/contrib/inventory/nsot.py
16:10:15 <allanice001> yeah
16:10:33 <allanice001> so the latest pynsot breaks that code in any case
16:10:42 <allanice001> in the example above
16:11:27 <gundalow> bcoca: What do you think would be the best way to move forward with this?
16:11:43 <gundalow> Feels like we are at the step before https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues
16:13:15 <bcoca> gundalow: it was in original metadata proposals, but we tabled it for 'future' and decided to keep a simple intial implementation
16:14:02 <gundalow> ah, OK
16:14:25 <gundalow> allanice001: Maybe poke us in a month?
16:14:41 <allanice001> sure
16:14:52 <bcoca> just to not get bogged down on 'all possiblities' and address the immediate issues on repo merge, but spec is open specifically for requriements and other dependencies (os/etc)
16:14:58 <gundalow> aye, +!
16:15:20 <gundalow> aye, +1, to why we just did the small bit initially
16:15:22 <allanice001> was just something i noticed, and, it’s probably only contained to contrib for now
16:16:00 <gundalow> allanice001: Out of interest, which network platforms are you using Ansible for?
16:16:07 <gundalow> #topic Open Floor
16:16:14 <allanice001> juniper, cisco and fgt
16:16:19 <allanice001> (fortigate)
16:17:19 <gundalow> fgt, not seen that before, where are those modules?
16:17:41 <allanice001> one sec, gonna hunt it down quickly
16:18:22 <gundalow> Just interested to know what people are using, not a massive issue
16:18:42 <allanice001> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfg/
16:19:00 <allanice001> and napalm also has decent fgt support
16:19:27 <gundalow> ah, so not Ansible, OK
16:19:43 <allanice001> not native ansinble, no
16:20:01 <gundalow> Cool, thanks
16:20:05 <gundalow> Anything else?
16:20:34 <allanice001> not from my side (yet)
16:20:39 <gundalow> :)
16:20:44 <gundalow> Thanks for your time
16:20:49 <allanice001> no sweat
16:21:19 <gundalow> We will be getting some extra people in the networking team starting soon, so more stuff
16:21:45 <allanice001> btw, hows yout vyos stuff going?
16:21:51 <gundalow> and at that point I'm thinking of getting a bit more activity in these meetings, and maybe get more of the networktocode people in
16:22:05 <gundalow> #topic Ansible CI testing with VyOS
16:22:13 <gundalow> Good question!
16:23:18 <gundalow> I've got VyOS machine running in AWS that can be correctly powered down and restarted (so it can be cloned) running
16:24:10 <gundalow> Just about to test getting the CI Test SSH keys loaded in via AWS' UserData interface
16:24:56 <gundalow> Once that's proved to be working I'll need to
16:24:59 <gundalow> 1) Template it
16:25:14 <gundalow> 2) Update CI script to spin up a VYOS machine
16:25:41 <allanice001> take a look at the api / cli commands
16:25:42 <gundalow> 3) modify ansible-test to know about network test, this will let you do ansible-test integration net/vyos/*
16:26:02 <allanice001> if you have the ami-id it becomes easier
16:26:04 <allanice001> http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html
16:26:36 <gundalow> We already have the ability to spin up machines in AWS via Shippable
16:26:45 <allanice001> ahh, ok
16:27:26 <gundalow> https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/shippable.yml#L10
16:28:27 <gundalow> Most of that is in AWS
16:29:43 <allanice001> #suggest at a quick glance, you may need at least 2 more macs, latest osx is 10.12, and some may be running 10.10
16:31:53 <allanice001> but really decent testing infra from what i can see
16:32:12 <gundalow> aye, mattclay has done 90%+ of all that, it's really good
16:32:26 <gundalow> cool, gona call it and keep on hitting VyOS
16:32:29 <gundalow> well, after dinner
16:32:36 <allanice001> cool
16:32:41 <gundalow> chat soon
