17:13:23 <sivel> I am here
17:13:30 <sivel> sorry, was making a giant response on an issue
17:14:13 <gundalow> #info Big testing documentation PR https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/23925
17:14:16 <gundalow> Reviews welcome
17:14:33 <sivel> however, I really have nothing to add.  I need to start working on some pep8 stuff, and legit line numbers for lint output in validate-modules, I just haven't had the time
17:15:00 <gundalow> sivel: FYI the validate-module docs have moved in the above PR, they will end up on docs.ansible.com
17:15:16 <sivel> sweet, happy I wrote them in rst ;)
17:15:24 <sivel> I saw the httptester docs are moving too
17:15:46 <gundalow> yup *.rst and *.md from test/
17:17:46 <sivel> Also, I haven't had the time, but I did create an issue to improve become integration tests coverage

17:18:11 <gundalow> ah, yes, we talked aboutthat before. Thanks
17:18:45 <sivel> I am working on another become issue, so maybe once I get that figured out, I'll try to figure out some more integration tests for become
17:19:08 <gundalow> sivel: let me know if you see anything obviously wrong in the Docs. Otherwise I'll get it merged soon
17:19:50 <sivel> gundalow: I'll try to get an eye on it soon, but I wouldn't hold it up if I don't.  We are at the end of our sprint at work, and I'm trying to get things moving
17:20:29 <gundalow> sivel: ah, cool
17:20:47 <gundalow> Well hopefully it will be more visible to people, so will start to get feedback on it
17:20:57 <gundalow> Anyone got anything else/
17:20:59 <sivel> yeah, I am a fan of getting things in front of people sooner
