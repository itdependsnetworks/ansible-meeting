19:02:18 * gundalow waves
19:02:21 <Qalthos> hiya
19:02:25 <bcoca> hi
19:02:28 <jtanner|t420> hi, may not be here for entire meeting
19:03:41 <bcoca> hmm, no agenda
19:04:06 <bcoca> can we close 'old agenda tickets'?
19:05:08 <jtanner|t420> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/100 ?
19:05:43 <bcoca> that is old
19:06:05 <bcoca> nvmd ... i thought it was the 30th for some reason ....
19:06:21 * bcoca will pass meeting mgmt to anyone that is not as sober
19:06:54 <bcoca> ^ so we have explicit `if __main__ ` requirement for modules but not actual def main() function
19:07:06 <bcoca> ^ proposal is to make it explicit, instead of implicit
19:07:31 <bcoca> also `if main` construct does NOT require `def main()`
19:07:49 <jtanner|t420> seems reasonable to me
19:08:06 <bcoca> any oppose?
19:08:16 <jtanner|t420> sivel, ^ your proposal
19:08:24 <bcoca> #action bcoca to update docs to make `def main()` explicit
19:08:31 <sivel> hey
19:08:36 * bcoca waves
19:08:39 <jtanner|t420> we're talking about __main__ in modules
19:08:53 <sivel> I was scrolled way way up, and was like I got highlighted, but I still see nothing
19:09:00 <jtanner|t420> heh
19:09:07 <jtanner|t420> that keeps happening to me in slack
19:09:28 <sivel> Based on the fact that I created a proposal, I am +1 for requiring a main() :)
19:09:32 <abadger1999> +1
19:09:53 <jtanner|t420> +1
19:10:07 <sivel> so seems like we have +4 ?
19:10:26 <sivel> since bcoca gave himself an action to update the docs :)
19:10:33 <bcoca> done!
19:12:16 <bcoca> soo, all agenda items done, floor is open
19:13:10 <bcoca> @rbergeron can we close old agenda tickets?
19:13:32 <gundalow> We've been closing tickets and creating new ones
19:13:34 <ryansb> yeah
19:13:47 <ryansb> old agenda tickets are usually closed after the meeting
19:14:16 <bcoca> https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/94
19:14:25 <gundalow> And any  undone items get moved to the new agenda item
19:14:36 <ryansb> ^ yeah, and that
19:15:03 <bcoca> also networking ones, but not going to push for those
19:15:54 <bcoca> anything else? should i just close meeting? got 45mins left
19:17:25 <ryansb> nothing from me.
19:17:34 <ryansb> probably give it 3 mins then close it
19:19:08 <jtanner|t420> queue jeopardy music
19:21:16 <bcoca> #60s warning buzzer
19:21:35 <gundalow> :D
19:22:49 <bcoca> so if no one else wants to bring anything up, closing up the meeting
