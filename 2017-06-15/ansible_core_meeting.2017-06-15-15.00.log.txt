15:11:16 <ryansb> Anyway, I'd say the big item would be to add stuff to https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-june-2017
15:11:21 <gundalow> YES :)
15:11:23 <ryansb> if that's not on the agenda already
15:11:24 <gundalow> thanks ryansb
15:11:51 <itdependsnetwork> sorry if I jumped in line. thought you were saying silent so let's close the meeting :)
15:11:52 <ryansb> itdependsnetwork: what would you like to cover RE: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/20717
15:11:59 <ryansb> no worries :)
15:12:07 <gundalow> correction: Updates go onto the sub pages of https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-june-2017-agenda
15:12:11 <thaumos> Oh no not at all, itdependsnetwork
15:12:22 <ryansb> I was just rummaging around for the agenda link
15:12:37 <thaumos> I assume you just want to have the PR merged, amiright?
15:12:39 <itdependsnetwork> @bcoca indicated that there was not consensus and didn't seem like it would be added any time soon
15:12:44 <itdependsnetwork> lol, yes
15:12:54 <thaumos> I'm going to review it from a product perspective.
15:13:17 <thaumos> we'll have an answer by next week.

15:17:16 <bcoca> gpl
15:17:27 <bcoca> handle import error
15:17:32 <bcoca> see ec2/boto
15:17:46 <bcoca> missign docs
15:17:58 <thaumos> isn't it gpl?
15:18:14 <bcoca> ah, nvmd .. was looking at module_utils ...
15:18:18 <thaumos> heh
15:18:47 <bcoca> well, import error is still and issue
15:18:58 <cben> which docs are missing?  RETURN?
15:19:08 <bcoca> cben: nvmd, no coffee today
15:19:21 <bcoca> just import error is an issue from what i said above
15:20:07 <cben> cool
15:21:04 <shertel> the return docs are empty though?
15:21:13 <bcoca> cben: on 'e' you might want to use to_native to avoid encoding issues, also yo have an 'exception' key to put tracebacks in (optionally)
15:21:24 <bcoca> shertel: that is fine if return is only common fields
15:21:37 <shertel> Ah, okay
15:21:58 <bcoca> those are already documented .. and people tend to document them differently ....
15:22:06 <bcoca> i've seen 7 diff descriptions of msg
15:22:34 <shertel> ha
15:22:49 <samdoran> Only seven? ;)
15:23:10 <gundalow> in one file
15:23:11 <bcoca> i stopped reading at one point
15:23:36 <cben> tracebacks (that we catch) normally represent server errors (it's a module that talks to a REST API)
15:23:55 <bcoca> understsood, that is why i said 'optionally'
15:24:20 <cben> so I wonder if they're useful.  If we have an unexpected crash we don't catch, user will see tb, right?
15:24:26 <bcoca> was letting you know of the facitliy, it does not display to user by defautl, it only shows with -vvv (though it is always logged)
15:24:43 <cben> thanks, I'll think of it.
15:24:46 <bcoca> if logged is enabled
15:25:42 <thaumos> feel free to poke at us more in #ansible-devel @cben

15:27:36 <gundalow> thaumos: Do we want to cancel all IRC meetings next week?
15:27:47 <thaumos> Yep
15:27:49 <gundalow> I think I'll kill Network & Testing Working Group
15:28:01 <thaumos> I already added in a comment before today's meeting
15:28:07 <gundalow> #info NO IRC MEETINGS w/c 19th June
15:28:08 <gundalow> cool
15:28:48 <thaumos> anything else to talk about folks?
15:29:20 <bcoca> im 4 mounts away from having all class mounts
15:30:06 <thaumos> ðŸ™Œ
15:30:29 <thaumos> Alrighty!  Looking forward to seeing some of you in person next week!  If not, be sure to attend remotely!
