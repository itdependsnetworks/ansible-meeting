12:57:06 <gregdek> The calendar is... um... quite advisory. :)
12:58:59 <pabelanger> o/
12:59:03 <gundalow> #chair?
12:59:16 <gregdek> So we're going to get started a little late as we have breakfast in the next room. Will check in at :15 past.
12:59:16 <gundalow> rcarrillocruz: pabelanger hi :)
12:59:19 <gregdek> Hi pabelanger!
12:59:32 <rcarrillocruz> heya
12:59:43 <rcarrillocruz> sad i couldn't make it onsite :(
12:59:48 <rcarrillocruz> at least i'm here :-)
12:59:55 <gundalow> rcarrillocruz: ditto
13:00:25 <pabelanger> rcarrillocruz: you are missed
13:00:34 <rcarrillocruz> awww
13:01:53 <jhawkesworth> hey.  sorry no voice today. sitting in otherwise silent office!
13:02:16 <gundalow> jhawkesworth: Ah, OK. Glad you can join :)
13:02:52 <jhawkesworth> audio currently sounds like what I imagine martian would sound like.  same for anyone else?
13:04:34 <gundalow> hah, yes. It's always a bit strange when no one is active
13:08:15 <jhawkesworth> cool. gonna top up caffiene before kick off.
13:09:51 <rcarrillocruz> good idea, me too
13:10:09 * rcarrillocruz goes backstairs for a coffee capsule
13:10:43 * gregdek waves
13:11:22 <gregdek> Well, looks like we've scheduled our breakfast to overlap with our first stretch of time. Thus, I'll round people up and we'll kick off with a soft start at :30 and I'll adjust the agenda accordingly.
13:16:02 <gundalow> skg-net: Hi :)
13:16:18 <gundalow> skg-net: We are starting in ~ 14 minutes
13:18:15 <skg-net> me: waves
13:19:12 <skg-net> gundalow: will joining in person

13:38:42 <gundalow> Thanks
13:44:42 <maxamillion> ahoy o/
13:44:49 <gundalow> maxamillion: Hi :)
13:45:19 <gundalow> maxamillion: you onsite, if not you need to join the BlueJeans link in the topic
13:45:28 <maxamillion> gundalow: I am, thank you though :)
13:47:38 <gundalow> Nothing from me
13:47:46 <jhawkesworth> nope, carry on
13:53:26 <gundalow> gregdek: Yes we can hear fine
13:53:31 <jhawkesworth> yep

13:55:13 <gregdek> https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-october-2016-testing-update
13:55:31 <gundalow> gregdek: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-testing-working-group
14:01:29 <sgallagh> Is Ansible hooked up with scan.coverity.com? It's free for open-source projects and supports Python vulnerability analysis.
14:03:50 <gundalow> sgallagh: Nop, but that's a good point, thanks
14:06:33 <jimi|ansible> hi jds2001! didn't see you sitting back there
14:09:53 <jds2001> jimi|ansible: im a sneaky guy :D
14:11:20 <bcoca> anyone have bj link? toshio wants to join
14:11:55 <abadger1999> https://bluejeans.com/3008457278/
14:12:02 <abadger1999> Found it -- top of the etherpad
14:15:09 <abadger1999> But do we have a playbook that creates the docker image?
14:16:00 <abadger1999> And do we have a bit of abstraction to be able to put different create and destroy of the httptester image if it lives in a different type of image?
14:16:19 <bcoca> ^ 3rd fallback, 'give me http address'
14:16:26 <bcoca> or httptester address
14:16:36 <bcoca> should not be hard to modify
14:16:46 <abadger1999> Yeah, httptester address would work for the 2nd.
14:17:12 <abadger1999> First question, though... perhaps that's something we have to write?
14:18:14 <bcoca> tests are in repo, people can contribute, as long as they dont break other test paths
14:19:27 <abadger1999> I guess I was thinking -- when the question of whether httptester could be made pluggable, it seems like we could make it pluggable if we had a playbook to generate the httptester image.
14:20:18 <gregdek> I think that's the consensus
14:20:27 <gregdek> But it's not the place to start
14:20:34 <abadger1999> That way if someone wants to create a local machine or a vm, it's easy for them to reuse the majority of the playbook to create that.  They just have to add the bits of creating a different image.
14:21:02 <abadger1999> otherwise, it's an opaque container of information and server responses.
14:21:35 <jimi|ansible> i think this is a round-about way of dealing with random timeouts and failures, which are a pain because shippable doesn't give us a method to restart a single job
14:21:47 <jimi|ansible> i think if we pushed shippable to implement that feature it would solve a lot of the problems
14:22:00 <jimi|ansible> re-running 1 out of 30 tasks is way better than re-running all 30
14:22:20 <jtanner> here's the code https://github.com/sivel/docker-images/tree/master/httptester
14:22:28 <misc> especially since they pay the bill, they should prefer that
14:22:35 <jimi|ansible> you would think
14:22:42 <gundalow> jimi|ansible: That's a good point, though unless we can detect random timeouts and trigger tests that's still a manual process
14:22:47 <bcoca> jimi|ansible: but then you also limit the ability of users to do same w/o access to shippable
14:23:04 <jimi|ansible> bcoca: not if they have shippable enabled on their fork
14:23:55 <bcoca> for internal use, not for external
14:24:08 <abadger1999> Yeah, if we have either a fallback (so it's no worse than today) or a way for people to plug in their own type of replacement, then it is a great thing to me.
14:24:53 <bcoca> jimi|ansible: yes, it can become amonster and it will do so incrementally
14:27:54 <jds2001> abadger1999: you're on call 24/7, right?
14:27:59 <jds2001> you never sleep :D
14:28:21 <jimi|ansible> jhawkesworth: do you write anything in python 3? I thought you were doing all powershell nowadays :)
14:28:26 <jtanner> i believe that is a true statement jds2001
14:28:40 <abadger1999> jds2001: :-)
14:29:05 <jhawkesworth> I do have some custom python modules.
14:29:06 <jimi|ansible> ihave no idea when abadger1999 sleeps, except maybe a short window between 2-4am
14:29:21 <jhawkesworth> no point trying to talk to oracle via windows for example
14:29:22 <jlk> It's like tempest, but for Ansible....
14:29:30 <abadger1999> I sleep when it's hot -- so I take a nap in my afternoon ;-)
14:31:22 <abadger1999> One piece of metadata that we are thinking of adding is a simple boolean "tested" whose meaning is just "This module has automated test scripts which we run regularly"  that will usually mean there's an integration test that is running in our CI
14:31:44 <abadger1999> (Note, that metadata isn't in metadata 1.0 but would be simple to add)
14:33:27 <abadger1999> *that piece of metadata
14:33:41 <bcoca> metadata is starting SMALL
14:33:46 <bcoca> we will expand as needed
14:33:46 <gundalow> ************* 12 minute break ***************************
14:36:59 <misc> until we need to have metadata about metadata
14:37:02 <misc> metaception
14:37:43 * abadger1999 works up a proposal ;-)
14:38:01 <gregdek> METAMETAMETADATADATA
14:43:02 <gundalow> Where do we store information regarding if there is metadata?
14:43:29 <sivel> jtanner: httptester is also in the ansible repo: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/test/utils/docker/httptester
14:44:22 <abadger1999> gundalow: It'll be in the module... Either the global variable will exist or it won't.
14:44:43 <gundalow> sorry, that was meant to be a a metameta joke
14:46:01 <gregdek> HA
14:46:04 <gregdek> I totally got it
14:46:17 <gundalow> :P
14:46:27 <gundalow> Jokes work best when you have to explain them
14:46:44 <gregdek> Next discussion: module curation
14:46:45 <gregdek> https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-october-2016-module-curation
14:47:39 <abadger1999> :-)
14:48:26 <abadger1999> bcoca: You talking about me in the background?
14:48:35 <bcoca> yes, i need an extension cord
14:48:52 <abadger1999> hehe .. ask jds2001 if he has a fedora friend finder ;-)
14:49:59 <jtanner> wtf is a fedora friend finder?
14:50:02 <rcarrillocruz> is there going to be a bluejeans for the zuul track?
14:50:16 <misc> something that find fedora friend
14:50:22 <gundalow> rcarrillocruz: Good question, I hope so
14:50:24 <jlk> jtanner: it's like the bat signal, but with an F?
14:50:43 <abadger1999> The metadata format for 2.3: https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/30#issue-170901038
14:50:50 <jtanner> jlk: i'll take one
14:50:51 <abadger1999> migration of issues and prs
14:51:00 <Shrews> rcarrillocruz: i hope so as well
14:51:01 <misc> jtanner: or a multi plug with Fedora sticker :p
14:51:04 <sgallagh> jtanner: http://www.malak.ca/blog/fedorafriendfinder/fedorafriendfinder.org.pdf
14:51:21 <gundalow> rcarrillocruz: I've added a note to the agenda. I think it may continue on this channel - given that Docs Sprint has it's own BlueJeans ID
14:51:23 <jtanner> sgallagh: aha, thanks
14:51:33 <rcarrillocruz> good, thx
14:53:12 <abadger1999> migrating issues -- will people find it useful for us to move them even if they lose ownership?
14:53:29 <abadger1999> gregdek: ^ good question for the room full of contributors
14:53:45 <gregdek> will ask
14:53:49 <abadger1999> cool.
14:55:26 <abadger1999> https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/30#issue-170901038
15:04:59 <abadger1999> +1 to gregdek's explanation of how things wrt partners are now.
15:06:47 <abadger1999> No, and it is full of worms.
15:07:55 <abadger1999> there's questions like "If modules end up in five separate tarballs, what happens for us and for downstream redistributors"
15:08:02 <abadger1999> The workflow isn't.
15:08:05 <abadger1999> The defaults are.
15:08:16 <abadger1999> But the workflow between the states is not.
15:08:49 <abadger1999> (About the module status and supported_by tags and how a module would move from one to another)
15:09:13 <Shrews> What about "new" modules for an "existing" set of related modules? Will they be preview/community even though the rest may be labeled otherwise (stable, etc)?
15:09:37 <abadger1999> Shrews: I'd say yes.
15:09:38 <abadger1999> But
15:09:51 <abadger1999> A team (internal or external)  can fast track it.
15:10:07 <abadger1999> it's a balancing act for the team.
15:11:01 <abadger1999> Only you label the module stableinterface you'll end up carrying backwards compatible code if you have to change the params in backwards incompatible ways.
15:11:14 <abadger1999> *once you label
15:11:18 <abadger1999> Shrews: ^
15:11:29 <Shrews> abadger1999: gotcha
15:12:29 <abadger1999> Committers probably want a say before stableinterface is put on a module to make sure that "common params" have similar names across modules.
15:16:46 <abadger1999> PRs are way harder :-(
15:17:13 <jlk> Prs probably have to be done by the person, not the system.
15:17:22 <gundalow> abadger1999: aye, though it was on the gDoc as a list of things to check, so I added it to the discussion
15:17:35 <gundalow> jlk: I expect so
15:17:39 <jlk> thankfully git gives you at least 5 different ways to get to a pull request, so totally easy to write docs for..
15:17:44 <jhawkesworth> I guess number of individuals who have a lot of 'in flight' modules is probably pretty small
15:18:14 <abadger1999> jlk: yep, if we did it, it would basically become read-only
15:19:25 <abadger1999> gundalow: thanks
15:19:51 <gundalow> abadger1999: I don't need thanking for asking akward questions :P
15:21:07 <misc> then thanks for not asking them more often /o\
15:21:22 <gundalow> misc: Challange accepted :)
15:21:28 <misc> (I have another meeting, so I do not even know what is the akward question)
15:22:23 <gundalow> :)
15:28:45 <abadger1999> what's Tom's irc nick?
15:29:04 <gundalow> abadger1999: I think the Google Tom is supertom
15:29:09 <abadger1999> Cool.
15:29:29 <abadger1999> jds2001: You just came for the free food ;-)
15:30:09 <jhawkesworth> sorry no voice today
15:30:37 <jhawkesworth> yes
15:30:45 <bcoca> gundalow: WEE CAN HEAR YOU
15:31:35 <gundalow> bcoca: We could see you
15:31:44 <jds2001> abadger1999: exactly :D
15:31:46 <bcoca> sorry about that
15:31:56 <gundalow> :)
15:32:12 <jds2001> abadger1999: i just came to see all the people who abandoned me :D
15:33:20 <gundalow> buuuuuuuuuurn
15:35:04 <gundalow> gregdek: What are we doing about the other proposed topics on the etherpad?
15:35:25 <gundalow> gregdek: there was some votes for Python3
15:38:50 <abadger1999> https://app.shippable.com/runs/57fb23d9b48edb0e0039b65b/32/console
15:40:33 <jhawkesworth> thanks all, gotta drop. If anyone is still around 3pm EST I'll join again. cheers
15:41:15 <gundalow> jhawkesworth: thanks for your time. When you return check https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/ansible-summit-october-2016 for where the different afternoon tracks are happening
15:41:24 <abadger1999> The 2 blacklists live in this directory: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/test/utils/shippable

15:47:14 <gundalow> gregdek: exception handling https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/developing_modules_python3.html#exceptions
15:49:19 <gundalow> gregdek: before we break where are Track 1 & Track 2 taking place (IRC/Bluejeans links need adding)
15:49:23 * misc has a talk on "how ansible support python 2 and 3" scheduled for pycon.fr this weekend
15:49:36 <misc> (but I didn't prepare anything, except some obscure jokes)
15:51:18 <gundalow> gregdek: is their a 3rd track?
15:51:50 <abadger1999> gregdek: If we need to setup a new meeting channel -- will need to ask nirik to get zodbot in there for logging.
15:52:56 <misc> you no longer have access to do that in fedora infra ?
15:54:47 <gundalow> Can you just do /invite zodbot?
15:54:49 * nirik can do so anytime you like.
15:55:49 <gundalow> nirik: Could you please add the bot to #ansible-docsprint ?
15:56:09 <nirik> zodbot: join #ansible-docsprint
15:56:26 <gundalow> nirik: sweet, thanks
17:02:31 <Shrews> gross
17:02:44 <pabelanger> lawl
17:03:48 * gundalow clearly missed something

17:23:44 <bcoca> depends-on <= HUGE feature for multi repo
17:24:03 <Shrews> oh, i recognize that commit
17:26:30 <bcoca> github exposes PRs as branches
17:29:16 <abadger1999> docschick: Can you turn the camera?
17:29:36 <jeblair> bcoca: i think something like a 21-deep depends-on change series showed up the other day in openstack... so it's been a hit :)
17:29:43 <abadger1999> oops, wrong channel
17:30:43 <bcoca> jeblair: we can barely handle a 1 deep depends-on in ansible

19:09:07 <jlk> In this room, nerds arguing over Linux on the Desktop
19:09:10 <jlk> (any year now...)
19:09:18 <jds2001> i gave up
19:09:29 <jds2001> my XPS 13 runs windows :)
19:09:35 <jds2001> and it runs wonderfully
19:09:55 <jds2001> putty and virtviewer are great things :)
19:10:53 <agaffney> I've been using linux on the desktop exclusively for ~15 years, but I'm not exactly the typical user
19:11:33 <abadger1999> jds2001: heh, I upgraded my mother's laptop from f18 to f25 ... amazingly, the only thing I had to fix post-upgrade was an selinux relabel.
19:13:16 <jds2001> agaffney: im semi the typical user.
19:13:18 <abadger1999> jlk: walk by one of them and cough: "systemd".
19:13:26 <jlk> that happened
19:13:36 <jds2001> agaffney: being a server guy, i want my desktop to just work
19:13:45 <jds2001> agaffney: i can muck with servers all day lonhg
19:13:51 <agaffney> jds2001: same here, which is why I switched from Gentoo to Ubuntu on my desktop :)
19:13:59 <agaffney> after initial setup, I've found Ubuntu to "just work"
19:14:33 <jds2001> agaffney: you might have taken a step too far :)
19:14:37 * jds2001 would have gone to Fedora
19:14:59 <agaffney> I like CentOS on servers and for "work" stuff in general, but I prefer Ubuntu for workstations
19:15:12 <agaffney> I *started* a step too far with Gentoo, and then took a step back towards sanity when switching to Ubuntu
19:15:24 <abadger1999> btw, is the real meeting done for the rest of hte day or is this just a break?
19:16:04 <jds2001> the only reason that I use Windows is I need some propietary software for one, and two the hardware of my laptop is.....bad.
19:16:09 <jds2001> (the non-dev XPS 13)
19:16:20 <jds2001> abadger1999: i think it's just a break
19:16:23 <jhawkesworth> yeah.  I was quite happy with lubuntu but hardware support was not great so back on win 10 for laptop.  at least I can fire up bash and pretend I have Ubuntu.
19:17:36 <abadger1999> k
19:17:55 * abadger1999 grabs a snack  too
19:18:21 <jhawkesworth> thanks for the py3 module porting page btw abadger1999 - that's going to be a big help
19:18:55 <abadger1999> jhawkesworth: No problem.  If you need anything else added to it feel free to bug me.  I sometimes forget to document things that I figure out.
19:18:58 <agaffney> my original use case for Ubuntu was on a Macbook Pro, because I was tired of OSX and the stupid things that IT at that company was doing with it (3 reboots in one day, all while in the middle of doing work....screw that)
19:19:40 <misc> agaffney: if were doing more meeting, you wouldn't have been bothered as much by the reboot
19:19:43 <jhawkesworth> we all do that, not enough hours.
19:19:45 <cinerama> wow that sounds really evil
19:20:56 <jhawkesworth> that just about beats windows update over the last couple of months :-)
19:21:13 <agaffney> the reboots wouldn't have bothered me if it gave you a chance to save your work, but a reboot without warning, 3 times in one day, was the final straw
19:24:16 <gregdek> Yes, it's definite hallway track now. :)
19:31:03 <abadger1999> gregdek, rbergeron: Need to turn recording back on
19:32:50 <jlk> we're back to zuul
19:32:55 <jlk> not sure if anybody started the recording again :(
19:33:21 <abadger1999> it's not.
19:33:32 <abadger1999> No blinky red dot i nthe corener of blue jeans
19:33:41 <abadger1999> excellent
19:34:04 <abadger1999> For the people who are going to watch the recording later...
19:34:39 <abadger1999> Having to listen to minutes of discusion on desktop linux is better avoided ;-)
19:34:49 <gregdek> We're back on. :-)
19:35:00 <gregdek> Or should be.
19:36:16 <abadger1999> yep, blinky red dot is back
