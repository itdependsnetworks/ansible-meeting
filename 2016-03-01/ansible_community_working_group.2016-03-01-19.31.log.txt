19:39:04 <rbergeron> #topic What order do we go in?
19:39:13 <gregdek> Seems like we should go through:
19:39:14 <rbergeron> Do we want to do backlog, in progress, ??
19:39:28 <gregdek> * Needs review, in progress, ready, backlog in that order
19:39:33 <gregdek> my $0.02
19:39:46 <gregdek> Even if it's just a cursory "no movey today"
19:39:55 <gregdek> (Which a lot of it will be today)
19:39:58 <rbergeron> Okay.
19:40:04 <gregdek> (since I can't seem to get my **** together)

19:45:52 <mordred> o/
19:45:59 <gregdek> mordred! yes?
19:46:07 <mordred> 19:44:37    devananda | hrm. ansible has announced switch support and posted docs. but it's not actually released yet
19:46:12 <rbergeron> :)
19:46:17 <mordred> seems like a good meeting topic :)
19:46:25 <rbergeron> is this ... like...
19:46:28 <rbergeron> the networking stuff?
19:46:32 <gregdek> I'm sure.
19:46:41 <gregdek> Got a link?
19:46:48 <gregdek> Because a bunch of stuff has been announced...
19:46:58 <gregdek> ...and is in core modules, even...
19:47:02 * rbergeron nods
19:47:05 * gregdek looks
19:47:14 <mordred> http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/junos_command_module.html
19:47:16 <mordred> gregdek: ^^
19:47:27 <rbergeron> #topic Random Meeting Topic: Networking Stuff :)
19:47:28 <mordred> gregdek: meet devananda
19:47:30 <devananda> I'm wondering where I go to consume that. maybe I'm just missing it
19:47:43 <gregdek> It's in core.
19:47:52 <gregdek> That documentation is auto-generated.
19:48:06 <gregdek> If it's in that documentation, it means that it's coming from a module that's released. (I think.)
19:48:32 <gregdek> Oh, wait... right.
19:48:39 <gregdek> No, this is all earmarked for 2.1 release.
19:48:54 <devananda> it's listed as being in 2.1, and in origin/devel, all that 'git grep junos' turns up is the roadmap
19:48:58 <rbergeron> https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/blob/devel/network/junos/junos_command.py <-- note "version added"
19:49:03 <gregdek> Yep, that's right
19:49:13 <gregdek> So that means you get it by pulling devel.
19:49:14 * rbergeron notes that this is a confusing thing for humans who see documentation and expect that something is there
19:49:24 <rbergeron> in terms of code :)
19:49:30 <gregdek> Yeah, that's an issue we should be tracking somewhere. We know it's a problem.
19:49:39 <devananda> well, i've pulled devel, but I don't see it
19:49:45 <devananda> but maybe I'm doing something wrong
19:50:01 <gregdek> Pull ansible-modules-core and ansible-modules-extras as well
19:50:10 <gregdek> There are three repos
19:50:11 <rbergeron> though i guess documentation does say what version, but i sort of have this user expectation that things written are already working :)
19:50:56 <devananda> rbergeron: if it said "version TBD" or "next release" or something, that might help :)
19:51:03 <rbergeron> devananda: and after that probably #ansible-devel might be better if it's not working still -- but we will make a ticket to like... maybe see about fixing that weirdness :)
19:51:09 <gregdek> #action gregdek will add a todo for a documentation working group
19:51:11 <devananda> thanks
19:51:35 * rbergeron notes this is just "meeting of community-organizatino stuff and not the general ansible developerish irc meeting
19:51:38 <rbergeron> "
19:51:43 <rbergeron> devananda: thanks, and @mordred too
19:52:29 <mordred> \o/
19:52:32 * mordred helpful
19:52:59 <gregdek> devananda: you should be able to get these by fetching all ansible submodules btw
19:53:35 <gregdek> (git clone --recursive I guess)
19:54:22 <devananda> yep, got it
19:54:31 <rbergeron> #topic Proposal for proposals.
19:54:45 <devananda> I think the issue was that I switched from 2.0.0.1 to devel, but didn't update submodules
19:56:20 <rbergeron> #link https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/23
19:56:28 <rbergeron> Okay, update is:
19:56:43 <rbergeron> #info Started working this and hope to god to post something today or early tomorrow morning.
19:56:58 <rbergeron> got sidetracked putting the community/readme.md and whatnot in.
19:57:01 <rbergeron> wrapped up.
19:57:10 <rbergeron> So basically: NO PROGGIE
